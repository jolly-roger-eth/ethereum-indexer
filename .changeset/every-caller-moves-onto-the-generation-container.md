Every caller, example and doc now names the GENERATION container: `IndexerGeneration` for one stream plus one fold, and the two FACTORIES for the browser hook.

This is the MIGRATE batch of the expand → migrate → contract rename the generation container needs. Nothing is removed: `EthereumIndexer` is still exported from `@etherfold/core` as an alias to `IndexerGeneration`, and `createIndexerState` still accepts a processor built over a store. What changed is that nothing in this repository reaches for either any more, so `the-old-indexer-shape-is-deleted` can delete both without a compile error anywhere.

**`@etherfold/browser` re-exports the class as `IndexerGeneration`, not `EthereumIndexer`.** A caller that imported the type from this package renames the import; the class itself is unchanged, and `@etherfold/core` still exports the old name for now.

**The browser hook is written against `{createState, createProcessor}` everywhere.** The README, both example apps, the `IndexerState` and `BrowserStateStore` JSDoc examples and every test now hand over the two factories rather than a processor already built over a store:

```ts
const indexer = createIndexerState({
	createState: () => createBrowserStateStore(myProcessor.entities, {databaseName: 'my-app'}),
	createProcessor: (store) => fromEntityProcessor(myProcessor)(store),
});
```

An indexer holds any number of generations and each folds into its OWN state, so the store cannot be a value handed over once — the hook is what calls these, once per generation. An app that needs the store it built (to rebuild a processor over it on a hot reload, or to read its capability report) captures it in the factory's own closure, which is what both examples now do.

**The CLI's source-text guard is asserted to still bite.** `packages/cli/test/engine.test.ts` enforces that the CLI constructs and imports no browser engine by matching the identifier with regexes. A rename that left those on a name nothing uses any more would keep them green and VACUOUS — enforcing nothing, with nothing going red to say so — so the patterns are now named functions and are asserted against deliberate violations under BOTH spellings, plus the prose and the generation CONTAINER they must not fire on.

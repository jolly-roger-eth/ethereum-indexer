Declare the packages the published types import, so installing them actually typechecks.

A type-only import is erased from the emitted `.js` but survives in the emitted `.d.ts`. These packages name types from `abitype`, `eip-1193` and `@etherfold/core` in their public declarations while listing those as `devDependencies`, so a consumer installing them got declaration files importing packages that were never installed.

Moved to `dependencies`: `abitype` and `eip-1193` in `@etherfold/core`, `eip-1193` in `@etherfold/browser`, and `@etherfold/core` in `@etherfold/utils`.

Measured against a packed tarball installed under pnpm's isolated linker with `hoist=false`, `tsc --strict --skipLibCheck false` reported 11 errors (6 for `abitype`, 5 for `eip-1193`) before and none after.

The bug was hard to see from inside the workspace, which is why it lasted. pnpm keeps a hoisted fallback directory holding every transitive package, so an undeclared import still resolves as long as anything else in the tree depends on it: `abitype` was masked that way by viem and failed only with hoisting off, while `eip-1193`, which nothing else depends on, failed everywhere. `skipLibCheck: true`, which most consumers set, suppresses the diagnostics entirely and silently degrades the affected types instead.

A test now asserts, for every package in the workspace, that each bare specifier in its built `.d.ts` files is a declared dependency. It found the `@etherfold/utils` case, which a search for the two known package names had missed.

**The storage seam gains a sync-cursor port, and `applyBlock` can write the cursor with the block** (ADR-0027).

`StateStore` gains `readCursor(key)` / `writeCursor(key, value)` / `clearCursor(key)` over an **opaque string**, and `applyBlock(block, mutations, cursor?)` takes an optional `{key, value}` that is written in the SAME transaction as the block. This reverses an explicit "deliberately absent" on the interface: a cursor that could only be a SQL table stopped one-processor-several-backends at the first deployment that was not SQLite, and only the store holds the transaction the block write happens in, so only the store can stop a crash from leaving state ahead of the cursor.

It stays a STRING and never a typed `LastSync`: that is a `@etherfold/core` type, and typing the port with it would make this package depend on core, invert ADR-0016 and drag viem into every storage primitive. `@etherfold/state-store` still declares no dependencies at all.

Per backend:

- **`@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`**: a new fixed `_cursor (key, value)` table, created by `migrate()` alongside `_blocks`, and the cursor statement rides in the same `batch([...])` as the block. `CURSOR_TABLE`, `readCursorStatement`, `writeCursorStatement` and `clearCursorStatement` are exported like the rest of the SQL.
- **`@etherfold/state-store-indexeddb`**: a new `cursors` object store, written inside the block's own transaction. The package's schema version moved from 1 to 2; the upgrade is additive and `contains`-guarded, so an existing database gains the store and keeps every row. A processor declaring another entity is still not a migration.
- **`@etherfold/state-store-patch`**: an in-memory map, written after the point where anything can still refuse. Its `durability: 'memory-only'` already says what that means for the cursor: it goes with the process, exactly as the state does.
- **`MemoryStateStore`**: the same, as the executable definition.

`@etherfold/state-store-conformance` gains a `the sync cursor` group: the round trip, the clear, the opacity of the value, and the one that matters — a store never reports a cursor ahead of its last applied block, asserted through a refused block and through a re-applied height. The suite's own tests gain a backend that writes the cursor before the block, so the new group is proven to catch it.

A cursor is deliberately NOT reverted by `revertTo` and not touched by `prune`: how far the caller got is not entity state.

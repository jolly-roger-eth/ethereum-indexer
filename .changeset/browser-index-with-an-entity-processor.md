**`createIndexerState` takes an entity processor, so a tab can index into the store the application chose.**

The two halves existed and nothing joined them: `createBrowserStateStore` built a browser `StateStore` and was referenced by nothing except its own test, while the hook's processor type was `EventProcessorWithInitialState` — the free-form-object interface — so an entity processor could not be handed to it at all.

```ts
const store = await createBrowserStateStore(myProcessor.entities); // one line picks the backend
const indexer = createIndexerState({kind: 'entities', processor: fromEntityProcessor(myProcessor)(store)});
```

**Both kinds are accepted and the caller SAYS which**, in a tag the compiler checks (`ProcessorKind` = `'js-object' | 'entities'`, `TaggedProcessor`, `IndexerStateProcessor`). A bare `EventProcessorWithInitialState` still means `'js-object'` and every existing call site keeps working untouched; passing the wrong processor under a tag is a compile error rather than a missing method three calls later. The discrimination is deliberately never a sniff for `createInitialState`, which a wrapper, a proxy or a decorator can make wrong in silence.

- The free-form path CREATES its initial state; the entity path READS its store through the handle the processor already exposes (`processor.state`), because there is nothing to seed — the state is in the store.
- **`keepState` on the entity path is refused**, with a message naming the store: an entity deployment persists through its `StateStore`, cursor included (ADR-0027), so a keeper there is a second place to persist rather than a second opinion. `keepState` stays optional and unchanged for the free-form path.
- `updateProcessor` takes either kind, tagged the same way.
- `options.createIndexer` now receives the processor as `EventProcessor<ABI, ProcessResultType>` — what `new EthereumIndexer(...)` takes, and the one thing both kinds have in common. A caller that annotated that parameter as `EventProcessorWithInitialState` has to widen it.

**Reload continuity is the browser-specific risk and it is now tested on a real engine.** `pnpm --filter @etherfold/browser test:browser` runs the hook through a captured stream in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, including a REAL page reload: a tab that indexed, closed and reopened resumes from its cursor rather than re-indexing from the start block. On `@etherfold/state-store-patch` a reload legitimately starts over (memory-only, ADR-0023), and the store says so in `capabilities.durability` before it happens.

**`@etherfold/browser` bundles for a browser again, and `@etherfold/utils` gained a `./indexer` subpath to make that true.** The barrel re-exports the CLI-side modules, whose top-level `node:fs` / `node:path` / `node:module` imports made `import '@etherfold/browser'` unresolvable for esbuild and for vite, before tree-shaking could help. `storage/state/OnIndexedDB.ts` now imports `contextFilenames` from `@etherfold/utils/indexer` (platform-free by construction), and a test bundles the package with `platform: 'browser'` on every commit so it cannot come back. `@etherfold/utils`' existing barrel is unchanged.

One processor, run under the single-process CLI and under the split indexer-server, is now a test rather than an assurance.

`packages/processor-sqlite/test/deployment-shapes.test.ts` takes ONE `EntityProcessor` (one `version`, one set of entity declarations, imported and not rewritten) and runs it two ways over the same captured chain: as a single `EthereumIndexer` doing fetch, stream-building and processing in one process (what `etherfold serve` is, and the intended CLI shape), and as a split deployment where a stateless log-fetcher pushes contiguous ranges across a wire to an indexer-server that hosts the stream-builder and the processor. Both land on the same state, including through a reorg whose replacement branch carries fewer events, so the global counter comes DOWN and an entity the replacement never mentions goes back to what the confirmed block wrote. Both are run against two storage backends (versioned rows in libSQL, versioned rows in a Map), so the four states have to agree and the backend is the only line that differs.

The input is a replayed stream fixture: the chain is captured once with `captureStream`, serialized once, and every run re-parses the same text, so the comparison is against identical bytes rather than two chain reads.

**The seam boundary is encoded so that closing it goes red**, since "the boundary is intact" is not otherwise checkable. Four ways, and the first is the load-bearing one: the indexer-server half is constructed with a provider that THROWS on every JSON-RPC method, naming the boundary. Because the same processor and the same core run both ways, a convenience added on the single-process path -- where one would be added -- is exercised again on the split path, where it cannot be answered. The other three: everything crossing the wire is JSON and is asserted to survive the crossing unchanged; the envelope is asserted to be ADR-0004's and to carry no `removed` markers and no `unconfirmedBlocks`, so all reorg information is derived by the receiver; and the receiver is authoritative about the cursor, with a batch starting anywhere else refused and nothing applied.

- **`EthereumIndexer.expectedFromBlock` is new**, and it is the ADR-0004 primitive the split shape needs: the block the next batch must start at, which a stateless log-fetcher cannot compute because it holds no cursor. `feed()` already refused a batch that started anywhere else (`generateStreamToAppend` enforces it internally); what was missing was a way to ASK, without which the sender would have to hold the cursor itself. It reaches back over the unconfirmed window rather than answering `lastToBlock + 1`, because re-fetching that window is how a reorg is detected at all.

**An entity store can start from state somebody else computed, and it stays honest about the history it never received** (ADR-0028).

This is the entity path's half of a capability the free-form path has always had: `keepStateOnIndexedDB(name, remote)` takes one or more published locations, asks each how far it has got, uses the furthest, prefers LOCAL state when local is already ahead, and skips an unreachable mirror rather than dying. A client that bootstraps comes up near the tip instead of replaying every log the contract ever emitted.

**`@etherfold/state-store`** gains the snapshot envelope and the store handle that keeps it honest:

- `StateSnapshot` -- `{format, processor, savedAt, takenAt, cursor, rows}`, deliberately shaped like the CLI's file envelope so a reader of one recognises the other. `rows` are the LIVE rows at `takenAt`, and `SnapshotHead` is the same envelope without them, which is what a client fetches to choose between mirrors.
- `openSnapshotAware(store)` -- the handle a deployment that may bootstrap uses on EVERY boot (it migrates the store itself). `.bootstrap(snapshot, {processor})` installs the rows and their cursor as one `applyBlock`, and records where the contents came from under a second cursor-port key (`SNAPSHOT_ORIGIN_KEY`), so a reload is as honest as the first run.
- The honesty: a bootstrapped store reports its retention as a **window whose oldest block is the snapshot's**, never the `unbounded` a freshly migrated store would claim, and an as-of read below that block is refused with `BlockNotRetainedError` instead of answering `undefined` -- which would read as "the entity was absent then", an ordinary answer a caller acts on normally, and wrong. The floor is intersected with whatever the deployment configured, and a store that answers no historical read at all is left saying exactly that.
- `RevertBeyondSnapshotError` -- a reorg reaching below the snapshot is refused loudly and changes nothing. There are no superseded versions under the snapshot to reopen at any price, and a partly undone reorg is a plausible state nothing downstream can tell apart from a correct one.
- `SnapshotProcessorMismatchError` / `SnapshotFormatError` -- a snapshot computed by another processor version, or in an envelope this build does not read, is refused rather than loaded.

**`@etherfold/processor-entities`** gains the client side:

- `bootstrapFromSnapshot(store, locations, {processor, finalityDepth?, fetch?})` -- mirrors, most-advanced-wins, prefer-local, fail over on error. Two deliberate differences from the free-form keeper: failover walks EVERY remaining candidate in descending order (the keeper tries the winner and one more), and a snapshot from another processor version is not a candidate at all. Given a `finalityDepth`, a snapshot taken inside the reorg-eligible window of the tip its producer had observed is declined, so the revert that could not be undone is avoided as well as refused. It returns a `BootstrapOutcome` rather than throwing when nothing is usable: indexing from the start block is the correct answer to "no snapshot is available".
- `openAndBootstrap(store, locations, options)` -- the boot path, which keeps the SAFE order the short one: open snapshot-aware first, then bootstrap only if the store has never synced.
- `createSnapshot(...)` -- the MINIMAL producer, and it says so. Publishing snapshots as a first-class artifact (a publish command, format versioning, mirror layout, pruning old ones) is a design of its own.

**`@etherfold/browser`** gains no API and one piece of documentation that matters: `createBrowserStateStore` now says how a browser deployment bootstraps, and that the store must be opened through `openSnapshotAware` on EVERY boot rather than only on the boot that installs a snapshot. The mechanism deliberately does not live here -- deciding whether local is already ahead means reading `lastToBlock` out of a stored cursor, and the cursor's codec belongs to the entity runtime (ADR-0027), which this package does not depend on so that it stays free of any one processor package.

**`@etherfold/state-store-conformance`** gains a `bootstrapping from a snapshot` group, so every backend inherits the obligation rather than rediscovering the trap in somebody's browser tab: rows and cursor installing as one unit, the origin surviving a fresh handle over the same storage, the revert refusal, the wipe still working, and -- selected on what the backend claims -- the floor being refused below and answered at and above.

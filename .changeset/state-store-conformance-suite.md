One conformance suite every state-store backend must pass, including its capability claims.

**A new package, `@etherfold/state-store-conformance`.** Adding a backend is providing a factory and running one suite:

```ts
await describeStateStoreConformance('MyStore', (declarations) => new MyStore(declarations));
```

It asserts EXTERNAL BEHAVIOUR only -- what a read returns after a write, after a revert, as of a block -- and never a table, a statement or a version column, so a versioned-rows backend and a patch-log backend can both be asked it. Five groups: versioned reads (a version is a COMPLETE row with a half-open validity range), as-of reads tested against what the store CLAIMS, reorg revert including a counter that must go back DOWN, read-your-writes within a block, and a block applying as one atomic unit.

**The capability report is read first, and then tested.** A store claiming `unbounded` is asked a read at any depth; a store claiming a WINDOW is asked at both of its edges and must refuse below it with a `BlockNotRetainedError` naming what was asked and what is kept; a store that answers no historical read must refuse every one of them. Testing a backend against a capability it never claimed would fail honest backends, and testing it against less than it claimed is what lets a claim become fiction.

**That the capability cases are real is itself a test.** The suite is run against backends carrying one lie each -- claiming a window it does not honour, answering an as-of read from the tip, accepting a revert without undoing the state -- and the tests assert which cases go red. This is why the cases are exported as DATA (`stateStoreConformanceCases`, `runStateStoreConformance`) with the vitest registration as a thin adapter on top: a suite that only registers tests can be run but cannot be asserted on. See ADR-0020.

**The reorg case is the load-bearing one and runs on every backend**, not once: an accumulated counter that does not decrease when its block is reverted is the canonical bug this design exists to make impossible, and the real instance is recorded in `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md` (a `computedPoints` of 12 going back to 6). The counter is accumulated through the mutation context, because the read is where the bug bites.

The suite runs today against `MemoryStateStore` and against `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`'s `VersionedStateStore` on a real libSQL database, each under three retention claims. Shared cases that existed as a second copy in `state-store-sqlite` and `state-store` have moved into it; what stays in those packages is what only that implementation can be asked.

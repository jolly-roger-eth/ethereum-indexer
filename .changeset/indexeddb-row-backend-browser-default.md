The browser backend, behind the same seam: `@etherfold/state-store-indexeddb`, and it is the browser DEFAULT.

**A new package.** Versioned rows in IndexedDB, so a tab keeps history, reverts a reorg, starts cold by reading one row instead of all of them, and pays a write cost proportional to what CHANGED. The same processor that runs on a server against `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite` runs on it unchanged, and `@etherfold/browser` gains the one line where a browser deployment chooses:

```ts
const store = await createBrowserStateStore(processor.entities); // IndexedDB, the default
const light = await createBrowserStateStore(processor.entities, {
	backend: (entities) => new PatchStateStore(entities, {retention: 'revert-only', finalityDepth: 64}),
});
```

Choosing the second one touches no processor code: a processor is entity declarations plus `on<EventName>` handlers over a `MutationContext`, and it names no backend.

**The default is a CONDITION, not a preference, and it is written down as one** (`docs/adr/0024`). On the real workload (the launched stratagems game on Base: 31,332 events, 4,072 live rows) IndexedDB beat wasm SQLite on writes by 1.6x to 6.9x and on reads by 4x to 14x on every engine that can run both, WebKit cannot run the SQLite route at all, and three of four tabs FAIL AT OPEN on both SQLite VFSs. The ADR records the four things that would all have to be true for wasm SQLite to win, and the five that would overturn the choice, from `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md`.

**It is not a speed-up.** The incumbent whole-state blob (`keepStateOnIndexedDB`) is the FASTEST writer at today's sizes: 2.0 ms/block on Chromium against 45.6 for row-level writes, a 20x throughput loss at 4,072 live rows. What row-level writes buy is what the blob cannot do at any speed: an as-of read, a revert, a bounded cold start, and a per-write cost that stops tracking total state.

- **It passes `@etherfold/state-store-conformance`** under all three retention claims, in node under `fake-indexeddb` on every commit and in **Chromium, Firefox and WebKit** via `pnpm --filter @etherfold/state-store-indexeddb test:browser` (the same suite, not a browser-flavoured copy). Evidence in `docs/spikes/indexeddb-row-backend-browser-default/results/`.
- **The bounded id-prefix listing is one `IDBKeyRange.bound([entity, ...prefix], [entity, ...prefix, []])` cursor**, asserted rather than assumed: the tests record the range the store handed IndexedDB and how many records it walked, because a scan-and-filter returns the same rows.
- **Retention is enforced on both halves**, so what it reports is what it does: an as-of read outside the window throws `BlockNotRetainedError` and never the tip value, and `prune` walks the `upper` index — where a LIVE version cannot appear at all, because `null` is not a valid IndexedDB key — so the row that IS the current state cannot be dropped however old it is. The window is measured against the tip read from the database, so it is right after a reload and right when another tab moved it.
- **`revertTo` is two index range scans** (drop what the fork opened, reopen what it closed) rather than a per-block undo journal, and `getAsOf` is one backwards cursor over that key's versions.
- **Four tabs against one database complete with zero row mismatches**, which is the case both wasm-SQLite VFSs fail at open.

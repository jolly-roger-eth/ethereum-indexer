`etherfold index` runs an ENTITY processor into a store, so the same processor object a browser tab indexes with also indexes on a server.

```sh
etherfold index -p ./processor.js --store file   --folder ./state          # free-form, unchanged
etherfold index -p ./processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db  # entity path, new
```

**`--store` is required and is never defaulted.** The two answers are not interchangeable: `file` keeps a free-form state blob with no history, `sqlite` keeps versioned entity rows that answer as-of reads, survive a reorg, and hold the sync cursor in the same transaction as the block it describes (ADR-0027). A default would hide that difference at the moment a deployment picks. `--db <libsql url>` accompanies `sqlite`, `--folder` accompanies `file`, and each is REFUSED with the other store rather than accepted and ignored. `--retention <blocks|revert-only|unbounded>` is settable on the sqlite arm; nothing prunes inside the index loop, because pruning is a call a host schedules (ADR-0022).

**The processor KIND comes from the MODULE, not from a flag** (ADR-0039). `createProcessor` returns `{kind: 'entities', processor}` — the same two words and the same shape `@etherfold/browser` takes — and an UNTAGGED module still means `'js-object'`, so every existing CLI invocation keeps working unchanged. A kind/store mismatch is refused at startup naming both, before any RPC call. `@etherfold/utils` gains `instantiateProcessorWithKind` and `ResolvedProcessor` for that; `instantiateProcessor` is unchanged for its existing callers except that it now unwraps a `'js-object'` tag and refuses an `'entities'` module instead of returning something that is not an `EventProcessor`.

**The engine underneath changed, and `EthereumIndexer` is no longer constructed anywhere in the CLI.** The command now folds through the two ADR-0003 halves with the transport removed — `LogFetcher` → `createDirectIngestion` → `StreamBuilder` → the processor — driven by `runFetcherLoop` plus an `AbortController` that stops at the tip, so the one-shot exits `0` at the tip and non-zero on a refusal no waiting fixes (a foreign `{source, config}`, the wrong chain, a suspected truncation). That is one server-side folding engine rather than two, which is what makes "the split is a deployment choice" testable rather than a claim about two implementations that agree today. It also brings the fetch cycle's machinery to the CLI: announced AND silent truncation detection, the cursor-correction protocol, backoff, and the five-report classification. `EthereumIndexer` is untouched and remains the browser's engine.

Breaking, and cheap because nothing is published yet:

- `--store` is now required, so an existing `etherfold index -p … -f …` invocation gains `--store file`;
- `indexToTip` and `init` are gone from `etherfold`'s module exports, replaced by `prepareIndexing` (which returns the assembled pipeline plus an `index()` that drives it to the tip) and `run`;
- `@etherfold/core` exports `resolveStreamConfig`, so a host can size a store's retention floor against the finality the stream actually runs with instead of restating the default and silently forking the wire's config hash.

Retention becomes a number a deployment SETS, a store REPORTS, and a read is REFUSED against.

**The unit is block numbers, and there is only one unit.** A deployment writes `retention: 'unbounded' | 'revert-only' | {blocks: N}` on a store (or on `VersionedStateEventProcessor` / `fromSQLProcessor`, which pass it through). `{blocks: N}` is the only window spelling: a bare number names no unit, a duration is refused on every spelling, and a count of updates is refused too. Those are not style rules. Time would prune on WALL-CLOCK progress rather than chain progress, so a stalled indexer would drop history it never finished writing and a halted chain would expire its whole window while the tip stands still; "last N updates" is derivable above the seam from the blocks each backend already indexes, and adding it below would duplicate the prune path, the report and the tests for a unit that is a floor block number. See ADR-0019.

**Sizing a window is not sizing a number of updates**, and the arithmetic is counter-intuitive enough to state at the API: on the real measured stream, event-bearing blocks are median **429 blocks apart**, so a window of 64 blocks holds exactly ONE event-bearing block. The default is `unbounded`, which is the only report true of a store that does not prune.

**A window below the finality depth is refused where it is configured**, naming both numbers, because reorg revert reopens versions closed after the fork point and would find them pruned. `finalityDepth` is required alongside a window for the same reason, and `VersionedStateEventProcessor` checks it a second time at `load` against the finality the stream actually runs with, since a floor validated against the wrong number is silent corruption waiting for a deep reorg.

**An as-of read the store cannot serve now throws instead of answering.** `BlockNotRetainedError` carries the block that was requested and the range that is retained, and it joins `NoSuchBlockError` under a new shared base, `BlockUnavailableError` (both exported from `@etherfold/state-store` and re-exported from `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`). ADR-0015 settled that an unresolvable block address is an error and not an empty result; this is the other way a historical read can fail, and it must not arrive as `undefined` (which reads as "the entity was absent then") or as the tip value (a plausible wrong number nothing downstream can tell apart from a true one). A store set to `revert-only` refuses every as-of read and keeps reverting.

**No store claims a window it does not enforce.** `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite` has no pruning, so a configured window is validated, warned about, and reported as `unbounded` -- which is what the store actually does, since every version ever written is still there. `MemoryStateStore` behaves identically. The right to report a window is earned by `prune-versions-outside-retention-window`.

`VersionedStateView` now exposes `capabilities`, so the consumer holding the read handle can discover at startup what history is available instead of discovering it from a refusal (or a wrong number) in production. The capability cases run against both backends in `processor-entities/test/two-backends.test.ts`.

A published snapshot a client cannot read is REFUSED, never installed as state — closing the last corner `tagged-bigint-codec-across-storage-adapters` left open knowingly (ADR-0040).

The blob snapshot's format number now lives in `@etherfold/core` as `BLOB_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT`, beside the codec it versions, so the WRITER (`@etherfold/cli`'s keeper) and every READER import one number. It used to be the CLI's own `SNAPSHOT_FORMAT`, which the browser could not see (`@etherfold/browser` must not depend on the CLI and still bundles for a tab), so the CLI refused a format-1 file locally while `keepStateOnIndexedDB` installed the same bytes — whose every `uint256`, with no fallback reviver left, arrived as the string `"123n"` instead of a BigInt. `isReadableBlobSnapshot` and the `BlobSnapshotEnvelope` type are exported alongside it; the CLI no longer exports a format constant of its own.

`keepStateOnIndexedDB` now checks the number on every remote fetch: an unreadable snapshot is refused whole (never translated, never half-read) and the refusal is logged with the location and both numbers. An unreadable mirror is treated exactly as an unreachable one already was — skipped when it loses selection, failed over from when it wins — and local state that is already ahead still wins over any remote, readable or not. A prefix-form mirror's bare `lastSync` file carries no format and is read as SELECTION data only: nothing from it is installed, and the state file it selects for carries the check.

The ENTITY snapshot envelope's constant is renamed `ENTITY_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT` (`@etherfold/state-store`; re-exported by `@etherfold/processor-entities`) so the two envelopes — which version different file shapes and revise independently — are distinguishable by NAME at a call site that can hold both. They are not merged.

Nothing is published under `@etherfold/*` yet, so no format-1 snapshot exists in the wild: this is a guard added before the first release rather than a breaking correction to one already shipped.

Stop the `"123n"` BigInt convention from mangling the hashes stored beside it.

Six copies of the same reviver decided a string was a BigInt by testing its FIRST and LAST character, then called `BigInt()` on everything in between:

```ts
(v.startsWith('-') ? !isNaN(parseInt(v.charAt(1))) : !isNaN(parseInt(v.charAt(0)))) && v.charAt(v.length - 1) === 'n';
```

That admits `1x9tbhn`, which is not a BigInt literal but an ordinary base36 `simple_hash` digest, and `context.processor`, `context.config` and `context.source[].hash` are all made of those. `BigInt('1x9tbh')` throws, from inside `JSON.parse`. In the CLI, whose `keepState.fetch` catches parse failures, that meant a perfectly good snapshot being read as corrupt and the whole state re-indexed from scratch, permanently, for roughly 1.25% of config hashes, with a log line blaming the file. The copies without a `try/catch` simply threw.

- The predicate now lives once, in `@etherfold/core` as `isBigIntLiteral` (with `bnReplacer` / `bnReviver` beside it), and every live copy uses it: the CLI, both browser adapters (including `keepStateOnIndexedDB`, the in-browser path ADR-0002 calls primary) and the fs adapter. A dead copy in `@etherfold/js-processor`'s `history.ts` was deleted.
- **`simple_hash` now prefixes every digest with `h`, so all hashes change.** A guard cannot rescue a digest of all digits ending in `n` (`8918n`), because that genuinely IS the convention's shape: such a digest came back from storage as a BigInt, and `processorHash === context.processor` then compared a string to a BigInt and discarded state that was fine. The prefix makes the shape unreachable instead of unlikely.
- **`simple_hash` no longer drops falsy values.** It filtered with a bare `if (value)`, so `{fee: 0}` hashed identically to `{}` and `{enabled: false}` identically to `{}`: a config change to a falsy value could not invalidate the state computed under the old one. `undefined` is still dropped, matching `JSON.stringify`, so a value hashed before and after a round trip still agree.
- `simple_hash` also accepts BigInt values instead of throwing on them, which a processor config holding a `uint256` would previously have done.

The suffix convention itself is still a guess: it cannot distinguish a real BigInt from a contract-emitted string that reads like one. `@etherfold/processor-sqlite`'s tagged `{__bigint__: "..."}` codec is the form that can, and is where the remaining adapters should go.

Answer "does the indexed state already account for this transaction?", so an app can lay an optimistic update over indexed state without counting it twice.

`checkTxInclusion(lastSync, queries, finality)` (`@etherfold/core`) returns one verdict per transaction hash: `included`, `absent` or `unknown`, with the basis it was concluded on. `createIndexerState(...).checkTxInclusion(queries)` (`@etherfold/browser`) is the same thing against the cursor the hook is holding and the finality depth the indexer actually runs with, which is also newly exposed as `EthereumIndexer.finalityDepth`.

Nothing is stored for this and no processor declares anything for it: the answer comes out of `LastSync.unconfirmedBlocks`, which already holds the reorg-eligible window as whole blocks with their events, and every event carries its `transactionHash`. The set maintains itself under reorg, since a reorged-out block leaves the window and a re-included transaction re-enters it.

The comparison is deliberately NOT against the caller's own receipt. A block height is a local opinion about a chain rather than an identity, and the receipt's block hash is the wrong identity: after a reorg the same transaction can be re-included in a different block, so comparing hashes reports "not indexed" for a transaction that is indexed, which is exactly the double-count. A window hit must also be behind `lastToBlock`, because `feed` publishes the whole new window before it walks the cursor through it.

Two limits are documented on the function: only transactions that emitted events this indexer indexes can hit (the window is sparse), and `absent` means "not in the window", so a caller must not ask about a transaction older than it, which a transaction the app itself just submitted cannot be.

 * hosted backend is one backend among several and never the target; its
 * `test/no-platform-leakage.test.ts` asserts that no source file there matches
 * `/\bD1\b/`. A HOST is the one place allowed to name its own backend, which is
 * why these numbers live here and why they are CONFIGURATION reaching the
 * store's `BatchBounds` rather than constants inside it.
 *
 * The numbers below are the DOCUMENTED ones, not measurements and not taste:
 * https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/limits/ ("Last updated Apr 21,
 * 2026"), retrieved 2026-09-01 and re-verified unchanged 2026-09-02. They are
 * per-plan and Cloudflare revises them, so
 * `work/notes/findings/d1-caps-bound-parameters-per-query-at-100.md` carries the
 * dated source and the reasoning; re-fetch it before relying on it.

/**
 * D1's limits, as the store's per-request bounds.

 * Two of the three come straight from the documented caps:

 * - `maxRowsPerStatement` is the CORRECTNESS one. Each row id a prune names is
 *   one bound parameter and `dropVersionsStatement` carries no other, so this is
 *   D1's parameter cap exactly. It is the same on both plans.
 * - `maxStatementsPerBatch` is the THROUGHPUT one, and it is where a Paid
 *   deployment stops paying the Free tier's price: 1,000 against 50. Under the
 *   pessimistic reading above, a batch this size spends a whole invocation's
 *   query budget, which is fine for a batch that IS the invocation's work and is
 *   the reason `d1PruneBudget` exists for the work that is not.
 *
 * `maxBytesPerBatch` is deliberately NOT derived from a D1 number and keeps the
 * store's own conservative default: D1's 100 KB cap is per STATEMENT while this
 * bound is per BATCH, so deriving one from the other would be a coincidence

### Minor Changes

- 0f33468: A NAMED INDEXER IS A ROUTE SEGMENT AND A REGISTRY ENTRY, on both halves of the wire.

  An indexer-server hosted exactly one indexer: `ServerOptions.getIngestion` resolved a single `LogIngestion`, and the ingest routes were the unnamespaced `/ingest` and `/ingest/expected-from-block`. It now hosts SEVERAL, each under a NAME an operator supplies at deploy time (ADR-0036).

  **`/{indexer}/ingest` and `/{indexer}/ingest/expected-from-block` replace the unnamespaced pair, which is GONE rather than kept beside them.** The name is a ROUTE SEGMENT and is deliberately NOT a field in the envelope: putting tenancy in the wire format would turn a misdirected batch into a payload error rather than a routing one. ADR-0004's `{source, config}` envelope and its refusal families (`409` resumable, `400` otherwise) are untouched.

  **`ServerOptions.getIndexer` replaces `getIngestion`, and resolves a registry ENTRY per name.** The entry is an object (`{ingestion}`) so that what a name holds can grow — a later generation model gives one entry several live wire contexts — without every host's resolver changing its return type. `indexerRegistry({name: streamBuilder})` builds one from a plain record for a host that knows its names up front; a host whose names depend on the request writes the function itself. Two named indexers on one server are isolated: a batch pushed to one is not visible to the other.

  **An unknown name is REFUSED, never defaulted: `404 unknown-indexer`.** A routing refusal, matching what the name is, and distinct from `501 ingestion-not-configured`, which a host with NO registry at all still answers under every name (a read tier, or a combined `run`). Both are in the non-retryable 4xx family a sender must not re-send into.

  **`createHttpIngestion` takes the indexer name beside the endpoint** (`@etherfold/core`) and posts to the namespaced routes; it refuses to be built without one rather than addressing nobody. `@etherfold/fetcher-host` reads it from `INDEXER_NAME` and demands it wherever it demands `INGEST_ENDPOINT` and `INGEST_TOKEN`, so a combined host that configures no wire is still asked for nothing.

  **The CLI grows `--indexer <name>` / `INDEXER_NAME`, REQUIRED on `fetch` and `index` and refused on `run`, `build` and `serve`.** The two halves of a split deployment agree on one name the way they already agree on one secret: `fetch` addresses `/{indexer}/ingest`, `index` registers exactly that name and refuses every other. The three commands with no wire route no batch by name, and refuse the flag with that reason rather than accepting and ignoring it.

  `StartOptions.getIngestion` on `@etherfold/platform-nodejs` becomes `getIndexer`, carried through unchanged as before.

- 56acbef: Every deployment shape counts the reorgs it concluded, not only the one behind an HTTP route.

  `etherfold run` reverted state on a reorg correctly and then reported `{absence: 0, contradiction: 0}` on `/status` for ever, because the counter was written by the HTTP ingest route and a combined process folds through the direct in-process wire and never touches it. `etherfold build` had no `Meta` table at all. So an operational counter was a fact about the TRANSPORT, and the shape the milestone calls the default was the one that could not report it. Nothing was mis-indexed: the fold was already correct in both shapes, and the equivalence suite proved it. What was missing was the observability, on the one `/status` field the two shapes did not agree about.

  **The count is taken where the reorg is CONCLUDED, and written by whoever OWNS the store** (ADR-0050). `StreamBuilder.receive` reports a concluded revert to a `ReorgRecorder` exactly once, whichever entrance the batch arrived through, and the deployment that opened the database supplies that recorder. The ingest route is a CALLER of `receive` now rather than the owner of a write, so a receiver that both concludes a revert and serves the request that carried it counts it once, and `run`, `build` and `index` all count.
  - **`@etherfold/core`** gains `ReorgRecorder`, `ReorgCounters`, `RecordedReorg` and the durable key names (`REORG_COUNTER_KEY`, `REORG_LAST_KEY`), plus `StreamBuilderOptions.recordReorg`. The keys live here because the writer and the reader are deliberately in different packages: a read tier owns no store and still has to answer "how many reverts does this database record". `recordReorg` is not hashed into the wire identity, since where a count goes is not something a sender asserts. `IngestionOutcome.reorg` is unchanged and is REPORTED rather than delegated: a caller that counted from it would count only on the shape it happens to be, and twice on the shape that is both.
  - **`@etherfold/server`** no longer exports `recordReorg` and writes no counters. It reads them (`readReorgCounters`) for `/status`, including on a read tier that folds nothing, and `ReorgCounters` is re-exported from core. Its dependency posture is unchanged: it still owns no store package.
  - **`@etherfold/platform-nodejs`** exports `ensureFixedSchema(db)`, the auto-setup step `startServer` already performed, so a process that binds no port can still create the fixed tables.
  - **`etherfold`** owns the one writer (`recordReorg`, `reorgRecorderFor`), built by `buildProcessor` against the handle the command folds into, so no folding command can count into a database it does not fold into. **`build` applies the fixed-table schema**, which it never did: it binds no port, so nothing else ever would, and a database it emits is a publishable ARTIFACT that must carry its provenance the moment it becomes an INPUT rather than an output.

  **A counter that cannot be persisted never takes down a fold or a request**, on any shape. That guarantee belonged to the route (`recordReorgSafely`); it lives in `StreamBuilder` now, so it is owed by every shape that counts.

  `packages/cli/test/equivalence.test.ts` drops the exception it carried and compares the `/status` counters between `run` and `fetch` plus `index` directly, through the reorg it already drives: the same counts, the same classification, the same block, and once each. `packages/core/test/oneReorgWriteSite.test.ts` scans the workspace and asserts there is no second site recording a reorg.

- aea6d2a: THE NODE SERVER STARTS ON A DATABASE HANDLE IT WAS GIVEN, and carries a host's ingestion and cursor reporter through to the app.

  **`StartOptions.db` accepts a `RemoteSQL` as well as a libSQL URL** — one option, two forms, because a host has one database and the only question is who OPENED it. The URL form is unchanged in every respect (same defaulting to `DB` then `file:./etherfold.db`, same schema auto-setup, same returned handle, same shutdown). The handle form is what makes "one process, one database" true: a process that folds a processor into a store hands the SAME handle to the server, so the store's writes are what the server reads. Two handles onto one URL would be two connections with two views of it — against `:memory:` not even the same database — and two schema-setup races.

  **A handle the adapter was GIVEN is not its to close.** `close()` stops the HTTP listener and leaves the database alone, so shutting the server down never takes a store's connection with it. Whoever built the handle closes it.

  **`StartOptions.getIngestion` and `StartOptions.getCursorReport`** — the two capabilities only a HOST can build, accepted in `@etherfold/server`'s own shape (resolved per request, since that is what the Workers model forces on the app) and handed to it unchanged. With an ingestion supplied, a server started here can host a processor and its `/ingest` routes work; with none, they answer `501` to an authenticated caller exactly as they do today, and `401` to an unauthenticated one, since the token guard sits on the path ahead of the capability. With a reporter supplied, `/status` reports the cursor; with none, it carries no `cursor` field rather than an invented one.

  This adapter still builds no processor, names no store package and knows no chain concept: it decides what the app's database, environment, ingestion and reporter ARE, and nothing else.

### Patch Changes

- 2e10f5e: A receiver now says WHAT it emitted and WHICH STREAM it folds, so a host can store the emission stream without deriving either for itself.

  `LogIngestion` gains `streamDigest`, the wide `streamDigestOf` value over the fetch filter plus the resolved stream config: the same name a stream has in the browser's stream address (ADR-0035), so one stream is one name everywhere. It is deliberately not `context`: the wire identity is a CHANGE DETECTOR between the two halves of one deployment, 32-bit per entry and over the whole entry on purpose (ADR-0034), so it moves on a decode-only change the fetch filter never saw and it collides. Neither is survivable in a KEY.

  `IngestionOutcome` gains `emissions`, the ordered stream of what was applied and what was taken back, with retractions carrying their original block. It is REPORTED for the same reason `reorg` is: `StreamBuilder.receive` is the one place that knows what the fold concluded, and a host that re-derived it would be holding a second answer. The `applied` / `retracted` counts are that list partitioned on `removed` and stay, so a caller that only reports progress need not walk it.

  `EmittedLog` is exported: one entry of that stream with the ABI taken away, which is to say the raw log the node reported plus the verdict. Taking the ABI away is the point, since a host that STORES logs is not a host that decodes them, and the decoded `args` are what some earlier ABI made of those bytes and are re-derived on replay against the source running now.

  Breaking for anyone implementing `LogIngestion` by hand (a fake in a test): both new members are required. Neither is optional, deliberately. An optional field on the fold's output is a hole with a polite name, and a receiver that quietly omitted one would leave a host storing nothing under a key it could not form. The Node adapter's own fake receiver is updated for that reason and its behaviour is otherwise unchanged.

- 1a6f68b: Every published package now carries a `description` and its own `README.md`.

  Metadata and docs only: no runtime code changed. Four manifests had no `description` at all (`@etherfold/core`, `@etherfold/browser`, `etherfold`, `@etherfold/utils`), which is the line npm shows in search results and on the package page, and seven packages had no README (the four above plus `@etherfold/server`, `@etherfold/platform-nodejs` and the private Worker host). Each README says what the package is, when to reach for it INSTEAD of its neighbours, a minimal snippet taken from code that runs, and links to the related packages.

  Two summaries are worth calling out because a guessed one would have been wrong. **`etherfold index` is a ONE-SHOT**: it folds to the tip it observed and exits, does not follow the chain and cannot be reconfigured while running, so keeping a database current is running it again; live reconfigure is `@etherfold/browser`'s ability. And **`@etherfold/utils` is not a bag of hashing helpers** any more: what is in it is the Node-side loader that turns a processor PATH into the authoring object plus its indexing source, since `contextFilenames` and the `@etherfold/utils/indexer` subpath went with the blob snapshot (ADR-0037).

  One existing description is CORRECTED rather than added: `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite` called itself a "state store for `@etherfold/core`", which names the wrong seam. It depends on `@etherfold/state-store`, `remote-sql` and `named-logs` and on nothing else, and a test in that package asserts as much, because a storage backend depending on the indexer would invert ADR-0016.

  **`etherfold` no longer publishes the repo's root README.** Its `prepack` copied `../../README.md` into the package, so the npm page for the CLI described the monorepo and documented none of its flags; the package now has a README of its own, committed rather than generated, and `prepack` copies only the LICENSE.

- 0bf9dc7: Package READMEs now link to sibling packages by absolute URL instead of by relative path.

  A README is read in three places and a relative `../state-store` link is only correct in one of them. On npmjs.com it resolves against the registry page and 404s, so every cross-reference in every published README was broken for the audience most likely to follow one. In the generated API documentation the same links became `_media/<package>` references to files that do not exist, which is what turned the docs site's build red.

  No prose changed; only the link targets.

- c0d694f: The acceptance gate no longer assumes an idle machine: every package that runs vitest sets `testTimeout` and `hookTimeout` to 60s instead of inheriting the 5s default.

  No runtime code changes in any of these packages. The bump is only because each gained (or had amended) a `vitest.config.ts`.

  Vitest's 5s default is fine on an idle box and wrong on a machine someone is working on. The gate runs `pnpm test` across the whole workspace, so suites compete with each other and with everything else running. Three unrelated packages timed out at 5s in a single session -- `core`'s base36 digest sweep, four cases in `state-store-sqlite`'s conformance suite, and `server`'s `sql2ts` round-trip -- each passing in seconds when run alone, and each blocking a task that had nothing to do with the code that failed.

  That makes a red gate ambiguous, which defeats the point of having one: red should mean broken, not "someone opened a browser". A generous timeout costs nothing when tests pass, since it is only reached on failure.

  The base36 digest sweep in `@etherfold/core`, skipped earlier the same day, is un-skipped: raising the timeout is the fix that skip was standing in for.

  See ADR-0032 for the rejected alternatives, including why a shared config file is not possible here (per-package `rootDir` puts `vitest.config.ts` under the typechecker, so importing a root-level file fails `TS6059`).

- 132cc1c: The one-shot is `etherfold build`, `serve` is only the read tier, and no command is implicit.

  **BREAKING, and it is the whole point.** `etherfold index` is gone and resolves to nothing: the word is needed for the wire receiver, which receives pushed batches, owns the database and does not terminate. The one-shot that folds to the tip and exits is now named for what it PRODUCES.

  ```sh
  etherfold index -p ./processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db   # before
  etherfold build -p ./processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db   # after
  ```

  **There is no DEFAULT command any more**, so a bare `etherfold …` now needs a command word: `etherfold -p ./processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db` was the one-shot and is now an unknown-option error. `etherfold` with nothing after it prints help and indexes nothing. The default existed so the rename from `ei` would not also cost users their argument order (ADR-0017); the name is changing anyway, and under a set of five names chosen so a reader can tell what a process will DO, an invocation that silently means one of them is the ambiguity the set exists to remove.

  Nothing about the pipeline moved. `build` keeps every flag (`-p`, `--store`, `--db`, `--retention`, `-d`, `-n`, `--rps`, and the `ETHEREUM_NODE` fallback), every refusal, the stop-at-tip driver and the exit codes (0 at the tip, non-zero on a refusal no waiting fixes). The package's exported `run(options)` is renamed to `build(options)` to match, and `main`'s injectable `run` collaborator becomes `build`, because `run` is a DIFFERENT command in the set being built (it follows the chain, answers queries and never terminates).

  **`serve` keeps its name and narrows its promise to serving.** It holds no processor, makes no chain call and writes no indexed state: it answers over a database something else wrote. That was already true of the code and not of the docs. It is now asserted rather than described: a server started the way `serve` starts one answers `501 ingestion-not-configured` on `/ingest` and `/ingest/expected-from-block` to an authenticated caller, while `/status` still answers, and an unauthenticated caller still gets `401` first, so the absence of a processor is not something an anonymous caller can probe.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 086de7b: Adds the platform-agnostic indexer-server and its Node host, and a `serve` command to the CLI.

  `@etherfold/server` is a Hono app that receives its database and environment by injection (`{getDB, getEnv}`) and imports no runtime: no Node built-ins, no Cloudflare types, no concrete driver. It ships the fixed-table schema and a `/status` route reporting database reachability, whether the schema is applied and at which version, and the last error this process saw. `POST /admin/setup` applies the schema. A test asserts the package names no runtime, so the property is checked rather than trusted.

  `@etherfold/platform-nodejs` is the Node host: a libSQL-backed `RemoteSQL`, environment from the process, served over HTTP. It applies the schema at startup by default (one process owning one file), which `autoSetup: false` disables.

  The CLI gains `etherfold serve`, which runs that host, so a project can start an indexer-server without wiring anything. `etherfold index` remains the default command, so existing `etherfold -p <processor> -f <folder>` invocations are unchanged.

  A Cloudflare Worker host also exists, at `platforms/cf-worker`, and is not published: it is a deployable, not a library.

  The server is a skeleton. It serves status and schema only: no chain logic, no store wiring, no feed. Those arrive with the tasks that follow ADR-0003.

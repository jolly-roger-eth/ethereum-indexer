# @etherfold/platform-nodejs-fetcher

The Node host for the etherfold **log-fetcher**: a long-running process that drives fetch cycles on an interval and backs off when there is nothing to do.

It is one half of a split deployment (ADR-0003). The other half is the **indexer-server**, which owns the cursor, the reorg derivation and the state. This process reads the chain and pushes contiguous ranges of raw logs at it.

This is the host that *drives* the chain, and it wants a runtime that can hold a process. A serverless runtime is a good home for the indexer-server, whose work is short and per-request, and a poor one for this: a cron fires on a schedule rather than continuously, and an invocation is capped well below what a first sync takes. So the usual split is a Node fetcher pointed at an indexer-server anywhere, including one on Workers.

```sh
pnpm add @etherfold/platform-nodejs-fetcher
etherfold-fetch
```

or, embedded:

```ts
import {startFetcher} from '@etherfold/platform-nodejs-fetcher';

const running = startFetcher({source: mySource});
await running.stopped;
```

## Combined: one process that fetches *and* processes

When the processor runs on Node too, there is no reason to put a network between the halves. Hand the fetcher a stream-builder instead of a URL:

```ts
import {createDirectIngestion} from '@etherfold/core';
import {startFetcher} from '@etherfold/platform-nodejs-fetcher';

const running = startFetcher({
	source: mySource,
	dependencies: {target: createDirectIngestion(myStreamBuilder)},
});
```

`INGEST_ENDPOINT` and `INGEST_TOKEN` are then neither needed nor read: there is no network to point at and nobody to authenticate to. Everything else is identical, because it is the same fetcher, the same stream-builder and the same contract, with the transport removed. The receiver still owns the cursor, still derives every reorg and still refuses a batch that does not start where it says.

(Building the stream-builder and its processor is the indexer-server's business, not this package's. `etherfold run` is that combined process built for you, and it drives its own loop -- so it takes `stopOnSignals` from here rather than `startFetcher`, which is what keeps "which signals stop a fetching process, and what happens to the cycle in flight" one answer:)

```ts
import {stopOnSignals} from '@etherfold/platform-nodejs-fetcher';

const controller = new AbortController();
const release = stopOnSignals(controller); // SIGINT and SIGTERM abort it
await runFetcherLoop(myHost, {signal: controller.signal});
release();
```

## It keeps nothing, on purpose

There is no state file, no lock file and no `--from-block`, and their absence is the design rather than an omission. The server is authoritative about where the next batch starts; this process asks, and a `409` telling it that it asked from the wrong place is the normal correction path, not an error. So:

- **Kill it at any moment.** Mid-fetch, mid-push, `SIGKILL`: nothing is lost and nothing needs repairing. The next start asks where to begin and is told.
- **Run two of them.** Redundancy needs no coordination, because neither holds an opinion worth reconciling. The one that loses a race is corrected, or ends its cycle as `yielded` and picks the work up on the next one.
- **Do not give it a database.** A block number written down anywhere on this side is a second opinion of a value the server owns, and it is wrong exactly when it matters (after a crash between a push and its acknowledgement).

## Configuration

Every variable below is read from the environment (a `.env` file works, via `ldenv`). Anything can also be passed to `startFetcher` directly, which wins.

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INDEXING_SOURCE` | yes | The `IndexingSource` as JSON: `{"chainId":"1","contracts":[{"abi":[...],"address":"0x...","startBlock":123}]}`. Must match the server's. |
| `INGEST_ENDPOINT` | split only | The indexer-server's base URL. `/ingest` and `/ingest/expected-from-block` hang off it. |
| `INGEST_TOKEN` | split only | The server's `INGEST_TOKEN`. Sent as a bearer token, and never logged or included in an error. |
| `ETH_NODE_URI` | yes | The JSON-RPC endpoint to read the chain from. Treated as a credential: only its host is ever logged. |
| `SUSPECT_RESULT_COUNT` | **read this** | Your node's real `eth_getLogs` result cap. Defaults to `10000`. See below. |
| `MAX_EVENTS_PER_FETCH` | no | How many events one fetch aims for. Default `10000`. |
| `MAX_BLOCKS_PER_FETCH` | no | The widest block range one fetch may cover. |
| `STREAM_FINALITY` | no | Must match the server's, since `{source, config}` is the wire identity. |
| `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TIMESTAMPS`, `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TRANSACTIONS` | no | Same: part of the identity. |
| `PROVIDER_SUPPORTS_ETH_BATCH` | no | Whether the node answers `eth_batch`. |
| `REQUESTS_PER_SECOND` | no | Rate limit for the JSON-RPC provider. |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | no | Wait after a cycle that reached the tip, or found nothing. Default `4000`. |
| `CATCH_UP_DELAY_MS` | no | Wait after a cycle that pushed and is still behind. Default `0`. |
| `MIN_RETRY_DELAY_MS`, `MAX_RETRY_DELAY_MS` | no | The escalating wait after a retryable failure. Defaults `1000` and `60000`. |
| `CONTENTION_RUN_ALERT` | no | How many consecutive `yielded` cycles before warning. Default `3`. |
| `RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY_MS` | no | The bounded retry *inside* one cycle. Defaults `4` and `500`. |
| `MAX_CORRECTIONS_PER_CYCLE` | no | How many `409`s one cycle follows before yielding. Default `2`. |

### `SUSPECT_RESULT_COUNT`: set it to your node's real cap

This is the sharpest edge in the deployment, and it cannot be closed in code.

A node that caps `eth_getLogs` **silently** returns exactly N logs and no error, and nothing distinguishes that from a range that genuinely holds N. The only detection there is is matching N exactly. The fetcher treats a result set landing on `SUSPECT_RESULT_COUNT` as suspect, halves the range and re-fetches until the answer comes back under it.

If your node caps at 5000 and this says 10000, the guard never fires: a short range is pushed as a complete one, the server reads the missing logs as an absence, an absence is a reorg, and a reorg deletes state. Leaving the default asserts that your node caps at exactly 10000, or does not cap silently at all.

Do **not** try to reach the same effect by raising `MAX_EVENTS_PER_FETCH`. That widens the span each fetch asks for, which makes truncation more likely rather than less. The two knobs mean different things: one is what this fetcher asks for, the other is what the node will silently refuse to exceed.

## What it logs, and what it never logs

Cycles are reported through [`named-logs`](https://github.com/wighawag/named-logs); the `etherfold-fetch` binary hooks it to the console (`NAMED_LOGS`, `NAMED_LOGS_LEVEL`). A run of `yielded` cycles is raised to a warning, because one is ordinary (that is what two fetchers do to each other) and a run of them is not.

No credential is ever written. `INGEST_TOKEN` appears in no log line and in no error message: a wrong one comes back as a `401` whose message names the variable. `ETH_NODE_URI` and `INGEST_ENDPOINT` are logged host-only, since `.../v2/<api-key>` is the standard shape at every hosted provider.

## Exit codes

- `0`: asked to stop (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`).
- `1`: stopped because no retry would help: a bad token, a `{source, config}` the server does not serve, a provider on the wrong chain, a suspected truncation. The process exits rather than staying up and achieving nothing.

Everything else is retried with an escalating, jittered backoff and never exits: an unreachable server, a `5xx`, a dropped socket.

/**
 * Capture the stratagems-on-Base log stream ONCE, as a replayable fixture.
 *
 * This is the only script in the spike that talks to a node. Everything else
 * replays `fixtures/stratagems-base.stream.json` offline, so that every
 * candidate sees the same bytes and no measurement is at the mercy of a
 * rate limiter.
 *
 *   node capture/capture-stratagems-base.mjs [--deployment <dir>] [--to-block <n>]
 *
 * Needs `CHAIN_8453` in the repo's `.env.local` (a Base JSON-RPC endpoint).
 *
 * WHICH DEPLOYMENT. stratagems has TWO deployment folders on Base (chainId
 * 8453): `base/`, an early one that saw 45 logs and was abandoned, and
 * `alpha1/`, which is the launched game (about 26,300 logs). The folder name is
 * misleading and the default here is `alpha1` deliberately: `--deployment base`
 * still captures the early one, and both `.chain` files say 8453, which is how
 * the confusion is checkable rather than arguable.

/**
 * How big is a snapshot of the REAL workload, and how does it compare with just
 * replaying the stream?
 *
 * The question `bootstrap-an-entity-store-from-a-snapshot` had to answer before
 * choosing what goes IN a snapshot: current rows only (small, and the store's
 * history floors at the snapshot block) or rows plus version history (bigger,
 * and the store gets a real as-of window). If a full-history snapshot approaches
 * the size of the gzipped event stream, then a client downloading one is paying
 * stream-sized bytes for something it could have derived from the stream itself,
 * and the argument for carrying history collapses into an argument about what
 * the client is really being saved.
 *
 * Run it (from anywhere; the imports resolve through the workload package):
 *
 *   pnpm --filter @etherfold/conformance-workload-stratagems exec \
 *     tsx ../../docs/spikes/bootstrap-an-entity-store-from-a-snapshot/measure-snapshot-size.ts
 *
 * It writes `results/snapshot-size.json` next to this file and prints a table.
 * Nothing here is a test: it is a measurement, and its output is committed so
 * the numbers in ADR-0028 can be checked rather than trusted.
 *
 * ## What it measures, honestly
 *
 * - **current rows**: exactly what `StateSnapshot.rows` carries -- the LIVE row
 *   of every business key the run touched, as the upserts that reproduce it,
 *   inside the real envelope.
 * - **every version**: the same rows plus every superseded version the store
 *   still holds, in the same encoding, as the CEILING a full-history snapshot
 *   would have to pay. It is a ceiling and not a proposal: no such envelope
 *   exists, because the seam has no way to install a version range (a version is
 *   what applying a block produces), so this number exists to be compared
 *   against, not to be shipped.
 * - **the stream**: the committed capture, as it is on disk and gunzipped, which
 *   is the alternative a client always has.
 *
 * Reaching into `MemoryStateStore`'s private version map for the ceiling is a
 * spike liberty, and it is the reason this is a script in `docs/spikes/` rather
 * than a helper in a package: there is no seam read that enumerates versions,
 * deliberately (ADR-0021), and inventing one to measure with would be inventing
 * the very surface the measurement is meant to argue about.

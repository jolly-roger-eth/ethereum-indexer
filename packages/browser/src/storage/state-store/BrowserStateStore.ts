/**
 * Build the `StateStore` a browser deployment keeps its entity state in.
 *
 * This is where an application developer CHOOSES a storage backend for the
 * browser, and the choice is a line of configuration rather than a change to any
 * processor: the processor is entity declarations plus `on<EventName>` handlers
 * over a `MutationContext`, and it names no backend at all.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // the default: versioned rows in IndexedDB (ADR-0024)
 * const store = await createBrowserStateStore(processor.entities);
 *
 * // the same app on the light store instead: nothing else changes
 * const store = await createBrowserStateStore(processor.entities, {
 *   backend: (entities) => new PatchStateStore(entities, {retention: 'revert-only', finalityDepth: 64}),
 * });
 *
 * // ...and either one indexes through the hook, with the processor untouched
 * const indexer = createIndexerState({kind: 'entities', processor: fromEntityProcessor(processor)(store)});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Does a RELOAD keep it? Ask the store, at startup
 *
 * This is the question that is specific to a browser, and the answer is a
 * property of the backend rather than of this function. A server restarts into
 * the database it left; a tab is CLOSED, and what it finds when it opens again
 * decides whether it resumes or indexes the chain a second time.
 *
 * The sync cursor lives BEHIND this seam (ADR-0027), written in the same
 * transaction as the block it describes, so it survives exactly as far as the
 * store does. On the IndexedDB default that is across reloads: the tab picks up
 * from its cursor. `@etherfold/state-store-patch` is memory-only by design
 * (ADR-0023) and reports `durability: 'memory-only'` in its capabilities, so a
 * reload there starts over -- correctly, and knowably in advance rather than
 * from an empty tab:
 *
 * ```ts
 * if ((store.capabilities as {durability?: string}).durability === 'memory-only') {
 *   // this app will re-index on every reload; decide whether that is acceptable
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `durability` is not at the seam because every other backend answers it by
 * existing on disk; it is on the report of the one backend for which the answer
 * is interesting. See `PatchStateStoreCapabilities`.
 *
 * ## Starting from a published snapshot instead of replaying the chain
 *
 * A tab does not have to index from the start block. `@etherfold/processor-entities`
 * can install state another indexer already computed, which is the entity path's
 * counterpart of what `keepStateOnIndexedDB(name, remote)` does for the
 * free-form path -- several published locations, the most advanced one wins,
 * local state kept when local is already ahead, an unreachable mirror skipped:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const {store} = await openAndBootstrap(
 *   await createBrowserStateStore(processor.entities),
 *   ['https://mirror-a.example/state.json', 'https://mirror-b.example/state.json'],
 *   {processor: eventProcessor.getVersionHash(), finalityDepth: 64},
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * **Open it through `openSnapshotAware` on EVERY boot, not only the one that
 * installs a snapshot** (`openAndBootstrap` above does it for you). A snapshot
 * carries no history below the block it was taken at, so a bootstrapped store
 * must report a floor there and refuse as-of reads below it; the floor is
 * persisted, and a handle constructed without reading it back would go on
 * claiming the history of a store that has been indexing since genesis. See
 * ADR-0028.
 *
 * ## Why IndexedDB is the default
 *
 * Measured rather than preferred, on the real workload, and recorded as a
 * CONDITION in **ADR-0024**: what would have to be true for wasm SQLite to win,
 * and what would overturn the answer. The short of it is that IndexedDB beat
 * wasm SQLite on writes by 1.6x to 6.9x and on reads by 4x to 14x on every
 * engine that can run both, that WebKit cannot run the SQLite route at all, and
 * that three of four tabs fail AT OPEN on both SQLite VFSs.
 *
 * ## It is NOT the same thing as `keepStateOnIndexedDB`
 *
 * They both write to IndexedDB and they are different seams, so the two names
 * sitting near each other is worth one sentence. `keepStateOnIndexedDB` is a
 * `KeepState` keeper: it serialises the WHOLE state object of a
 * `JSObjectEventProcessor` on every save, which is the fastest writer at today's
 * sizes (2.0 ms/block on Chromium) precisely because it keeps no history, cannot
 * answer an as-of read and cannot revert. This builds a `StateStore`: the state
 * IS versioned rows, so a write costs what CHANGED, a reload reads only what it
 * asks for, a reorg is a revert, and history is readable to the declared
 * retention. A deployment uses one or the other, according to which processor it
 * runs.

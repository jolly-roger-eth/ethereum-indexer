 * `idb-keyval`'s DEFAULT database and object store, re-derived.
 *
 * `defaultGetStore` is module-private, so naming the two strings is the ONLY way
 * to get a `UseStore` -- the escape hatch `createStore` returns, and the only
 * route to a key RANGE -- over the very store the bare `get`/`set` calls reach.
 * That is load-bearing rather than incidental. A keeper that quietly opened a
 * store of its own would never SEE the legacy blob it is required to delete, it
 * would make "an unrelated key in the same store survives `clear`" vacuous, and
 * it would remove the whole ground for banning `idb-keyval`'s `clear()`, which
 * is dangerous exactly BECAUSE the stream shares one store with everything else
 * this package writes.
 *
 * It lives in a module of its own because the stream keeper is no longer the
 * only thing addressing that store: the generation registry keeps its records
 * beside them and SWEEPS stream subtrees nothing claims, and a registry holding
 * a second connection to the same database would be a second opinion about what
 * is stored.

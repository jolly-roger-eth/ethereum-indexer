 *
 * An earlier design packed these components into one delimited STRING and then
 * needed an anchored regex, a cross-chain corruption hazard (`stream_tag_1` is a
 * prefix of `stream_tag_10_0`), a temp-name rule and an extra keeper operation.
 * All of that was a consequence of the flat namespace: comparing key ELEMENTS
 * cannot confuse chain `1` with chain `10`, so the hazard is gone rather than
 * guarded. There is no string-prefix matching anywhere below.
 *
 * The DIGEST level is `@etherfold/core`'s `streamDigestOf`: what the stream
 * CONTAINS -- its fetch filter and its stream config -- and nothing about who
 * indexed it. `chainId` is not a level of its own because that digest already
 * covers it (its block-0 skeleton entry hashes `chainId` and `genesisHash`), and
 * `<indexer-name>` is the caller-supplied discriminator, untouched here. This
 * level held a `chain-<chainId>` PLACEHOLDER while the digest was being built;
 * subtrees written under it are simply unreachable now, and disposing of them
 * belongs to the sweep in the generation registry, which is the only place that
 * can know which digests are registered.
 *
 * It is addressed BY THE DIGEST rather than by a `{source, config}` because that
 * sweep reaches subtrees it cannot resolve a source for: an orphan is a digest
 * and nothing else. `streamAddress` below is the same subtree for a caller that
 * has the source in hand.

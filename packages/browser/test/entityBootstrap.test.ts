/**
 * A tab that comes up from state somebody else computed.
 *
 * This is where the capability is worth having, and it is the one the retired
 * free-form path had first: its `keepStateOnIndexedDB(name, remote)` let a new
 * tab of a shipped app download a published snapshot instead of replaying every
 * log the contract emitted, and the entity path would have quietly lost that
 * when the free-form one was deleted (ADR-0037). The mechanism lives in `@etherfold/processor-entities` (the store's
 * cursor is an opaque string, so only the layer that owns its codec can ask "is
 * local already ahead"), and these cases check it through the hook an
 * application actually wires.
 *
 * The assertion that matters is about the RANGES the tab asks its node for, not
 * about the state it ends on: re-indexing from the start block lands on the same
 * rows, so only the requests can tell the two apart. It is the same shape as the
 * reload case in `entityIndexing.test.ts`, one door further out -- there the tab
 * resumes from state IT computed, here from state it was given.

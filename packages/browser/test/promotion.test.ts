/**
 * THE PROMOTION POLICY, from the runtime this spec is FOR.
 *
 * The policy itself, its trigger and drop-on-promotion are pinned in
 * `@etherfold/core`'s `promotion.test.ts`, over a container with no browser in
 * sight. What is only observable HERE is the runtime's own half of the claim:
 *
 * - **the default is `on-catch-up` in this runtime too**, because this hook
 *   deliberately selects nothing. There is no per-runtime default anywhere,
 *   since the axis that would justify one (development versus production) is not
 *   detectable from inside a browser build;
 * - a RECONFIGURE is not an outage: the app goes on reading complete answers
 *   from the canonical generation while the new one folds beside it, and the
 *   answers switch when it is ready (stories 1, 3 and 14);
 * - `immediate` is the opt-in a developer iterating on a fold asks for (story
 *   13), and what it DEGRADES -- `checkTxInclusion` -- degrades honestly.
 *
 * The successor here is the ordinary reconfigure: a processor change, on the
 * stream that is already there. So it is a FOLLOWER and fetches nothing, which
 * is why these tests hand the hook a real stream keeper -- without a stream to
 * fold, a generation sharing one has no way to advance at all.

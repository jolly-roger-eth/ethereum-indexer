/**
 * THE GENERATION CONTAINER, from the browser side: both call shapes, and the
 * handle that follows the canonical pointer.
 *
 * An indexer holds any number of GENERATIONS -- a stream plus a fold over it --
 * and one of them is canonical and answers every read. This file asserts the two
 * things that are only observable here, on the ENTITY path with real stores:
 *
 * - `createIndexerState` accepts BOTH the shape that is handed a built processor
 *   and the shape that is handed the factories to build one, and both index.
 * - the state handle a consumer holds is INDIRECT, so holding it across a
 *   pointer move is never a way to read a retired generation (story 6).
 *
 * The container's own rules -- the pointer applied AT a notification, one
 * generation per read interval -- are asserted where they live, in
 * `@etherfold/core`'s `container.test.ts`.

/**
 * STORY 12: A GENERATION WHOSE STREAM IS UNUSABLE FALLS BACK TO A FULL
 * RE-INDEX, which is today's behaviour, so the feature degrades rather than
 * breaks.
 *
 * The rule itself is asserted against the core helper and the wrapper
 * (`@etherfold/core`'s `streamSegments.test.ts` and `degradingStream.test.ts`).
 * What is only observable HERE is the ROUND TRIP through the one stream keeper
 * that actually exists -- the browser's IndexedDB keeper over core's segmented
 * helper -- and, more to the point, what an APP experiences when the store under
 * it is gone: an indexer that still loads, still indexes and still answers,
 * paying one re-fetch for a cache it could not read.
 *
 * The failure this pins is not hypothetical: a browser can and does refuse to
 * open IndexedDB (private browsing, storage evicted or blocked, a database at a
 * version this build cannot open). `fetchFrom` and `clear` are called on the
 * load path with no `try`/`catch` above them, so a keeper that raised there
 * would leave the indexer permanently unloadable.

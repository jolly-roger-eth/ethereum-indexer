/**
 * The two reload axes a hot-reloading template has to get right, DRIVEN.
 *
 * `updateProcessor` and `updateIndexer` have existed since `0.7.6` and no
 * application in the family has ever called either. The tests that existed
 * covered the browser layer's own bookkeeping -- that a reconfigure is
 * serialised, that the auto-index loop is paused, that stale syncing state is
 * cleared on success only -- against a processor fake whose `process` returns a
 * constant and whose `load` returns nothing. None of them could observe the
 * thing an integrator actually cares about: whether the STATE survives, and
 * whether that answer is the right one.
 *
 * So these run a real entity processor over a real store against a real captured
 * stream, and ask about the rows.
 *
 * The axes are independent, and the deployment shape is why. These apps deploy
 * behind a PROXY on local, so a redeploy does not move the address: axis two is
 * a new ABI at an address that already has indexed history. Axis one is the
 * developer editing the reducer, which the chain knows nothing about.

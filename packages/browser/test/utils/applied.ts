/**
 * The vehicle the STREAM tests drive: a processor that records what it applied.
 *
 * These suites are about the stream cache and the stream keeper, not about the
 * processor, so what they need from one is the smallest thing that makes a
 * replay observable -- WHICH events reached a handler, in chain order, and HOW
 * MANY TIMES each did.
 *
 * `times` is the load-bearing field. The question every case here asks is
 * whether a replayed block is applied ONCE, and a store that simply overwrote a
 * row would hide a double application behind an idempotent-looking write.
 *
 * The id starts with a constant `bucket` because the seam's only set read is a
 * PREFIX of the declared id (ADR-0021): the bucket is what makes "every event
 * this processor applied" a prefix, and `at` (block number then log index, both
 * fixed-width, so the lexicographic order is the chain's) is what makes the
 * listing come back in the order the events arrived.

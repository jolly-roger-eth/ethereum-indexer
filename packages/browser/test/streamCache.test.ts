/**
 * The stream cache against the REAL keeper, on `fake-indexeddb`.
 *
 * The engine's arithmetic is pinned in `@etherfold/core`'s own suite against an
 * in-memory keeper; what these add is the deployment shape the fix exists for --
 * a browser tab that goes away between the stream write and the state write, and
 * a browser store that refuses to be written to. The claim is about what the
 * NODE was asked for, so every assertion here reads the ranges the fake chain
 * recorded, the way `invalidation.test.ts` does: a replay and a re-fetch land on
 * identical state and cannot be told apart by reading it.

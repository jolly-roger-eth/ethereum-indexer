/**
 * STORY 5: A NON-CANONICAL GENERATION REPORTS THAT IT EXISTS AND HOW FAR IT HAS
 * CAUGHT UP -- and the library stops there.
 *
 * Only the developer knows whether their reconfigure made the old answers WRONG
 * or merely INCOMPLETE, so the library reports the FACT and the DISTANCE and the
 * app decides whether to render, dim or hide. A library that picked would be
 * picking wrong half the time, so the assertion below is deliberately shaped as
 * three DIFFERENT apps reading the same reported state and reaching three
 * different, defensible conclusions from it.
 *
 * The reporting is DERIVED from the container rather than recorded in a second
 * place: every generation's cursor is already kept there (the promotion trigger
 * is a comparison between two of them), and a second copy in this hook would be
 * a second thing to keep true.

 * the end of the very cycle it was created in. What it CAN be given is less
 * stream -- which is what being behind IS, from the follower's side -- so the cap
 * truncates what `fetchFrom` serves, and lifting it lets the follower catch up

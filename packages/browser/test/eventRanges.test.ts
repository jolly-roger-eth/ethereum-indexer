/**
 * AN UPGRADE APPENDS AN ENTRY INSTEAD OF RE-FETCHING HISTORY.
 *
 * The headline is NOT that the state survives. `indexerMatches` gates the kept
 * event STREAM as well as the state, so what an append actually buys is that
 * NOTHING IS RE-FETCHED -- and state cannot tell you whether that happened,
 * because a re-index and a resume land on identical rows. So every claim here is
 * asserted on the RANGES the node was asked for, with `{stateDiscarded}` as the
 * second reading rather than the first.
 *
 * The fixture is the one `reconfigure.test.ts` drives: a real entity processor
 * over a real IndexedDB store against the recording fake chain. What is new is
 * that the source DECLARES the block ranges its events are live over, so an
 * upgraded implementation adding an event is an APPEND rather than a whole new
 * source hash.

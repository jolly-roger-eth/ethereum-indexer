/**
 * A browser tab indexing with an entity processor, on the engines it has to work
 * on.
 *
 * The node tests ask the same questions of the same workload under
 * `fake-indexeddb`. What a shim cannot show is exactly what this path is for:
 * a real transaction scheduler, a real database that outlives a page, and a real
 * RELOAD, which is the browser-specific risk in the whole feature (a tab that
 * indexes, closes and reopens must CONTINUE, not start again).
 *
 * Deliberately not part of `pnpm test`, which is what the acceptance gate runs:
 * this needs `playwright install` and three browser binaries a clean CI checkout
 * does not have, and a gate that cannot run on a clean checkout is a gate that
 * gets skipped.

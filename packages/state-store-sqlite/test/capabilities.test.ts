 * it from a wrong number in production.
 *
 * That a claim is HONOURED -- answering inside a window, refusing outside it,
 * refusing everything when the store keeps history for revert alone -- is
 * asserted against every backend by `@etherfold/state-store-conformance` (see
 * `conformance.test.ts`), which reads the report and tests behaviour against it.
 * What is asserted here is what only this package can say: WHICH claim it makes
 * and why, what it does with a retention setting a deployment writes, and how
 * the refusal behaves on the surfaces that are this backend's own (the
 * whole-table query and the hash and timestamp address axes).

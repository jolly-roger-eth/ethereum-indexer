/**
 * The DELETE-before-re-open ordering, pinned in BOTH directions.
 *
 * `revertTo` must (A) DELETE versions opened above the fork before it (B)
 * re-opens versions closed above it. SQLite enforces the partial unique index
 * `(id) WHERE _upper IS NULL` per statement, with no deferred mode: re-opening
 * first makes the re-opened row and the still-present dead-branch row both open
 * for the same id, which is a UNIQUE violation.
 *
 * Asserting only that the right order works would let a future refactor swap the
 * two statements and "clean up" a rule it could not see the reason for. So the
 * wrong order is executed here, against a real SQLite engine, and its failure is
 * asserted. This test IS the documentation of why the order is what it is.

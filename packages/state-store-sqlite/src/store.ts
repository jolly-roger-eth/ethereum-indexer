	 * folded into `applyBlock`: a prune plus `VACUUM` measured 1.1 seconds at
	 * 62,553 versions (`work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md`) while a
	 * block on the same stream carries a median of 7 mutations, so a prune in the

	 * `prune({maxVersions: n})` on a schedule the host owns; a background policy is
	 * this call on a timer. Both are built on this verb; neither is guessed here.
	 *
	 * ## What it is bounded by, per request
	 *
	 * One statement never names more than `bounds.maxRowsPerStatement` row ids, so
	 * a prune of a hundred thousand versions is a sequence of ordinary small
	 * requests rather than one statement a hosted backend rejects. The row ids are
	 * SELECTed first rather than deleted blind by predicate, because `remote-sql`
	 * reports rows and not an affected-row count: selecting is what makes the
	 * report a fact and what tells the loop it has finished.
	 *
	 * ## What it never touches
	 *
	 * The LIVE version of every entity, however old (`prunableVersionsStatement`),
	 * and the block table. A block row is 3 columns and is how an address resolves;
	 * dropping it would turn `BlockNotRetainedError` ("that block is fine, its
	 * state is outside what I keep") into `NoSuchBlockError` ("never indexed, or
	 * reorged out"), which is a worse answer and, for a consumer that pinned the
	 * hash, a wrong one.
	 *
	 * It does not `VACUUM` either. `VACUUM` cannot run inside a transaction, which
	 * is the only thing `remote-sql` exposes for writes, it rewrites the whole file,
	 * and it is not available on every backend behind that interface. Without it
	 * SQLite keeps the freed pages on its freelist and REUSES them, so the file
	 * stops growing even though it does not shrink; an operator who wants the space
	 * back runs `VACUUM` on the database itself, at a moment of their choosing.

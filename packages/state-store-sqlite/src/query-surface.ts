/**
 * ## The SERVER-side tier of the generated read surface
 *
 * The same entity declarations, the same typed rows, plus the two reads only a
 * backend with a query planner underneath it can honestly offer: a whole entity
 * at the tip or as of a block, with a caller-supplied predicate, ordering and
 * page.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const surface = createQuerySurface(store, entities);
 *
 * await surface.token.getCurrent({id: '1'});                        // the bounded tier, on every backend
 * await surface.token.queryCurrent({where: 'owner = ?', args: [a]}); // this tier, here only
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the two tiers differ, where a reader meets them
 *
 * `createReadSurface` (`@etherfold/state-store`) is bounded BY CONSTRUCTION: a
 * prefix of the declared id plus a required limit, no predicate, no ordering, no
 * offset. That is not caution, it is placement. Those reads are the ones a
 * HANDLER is held to, and a handler runs once per event on every backend
 * including the ones with no query planner, so the seam gets the one shape that
 * is an indexed range scan everywhere (ADR-0021) and an accidental full scan is
 * impossible to express.
 *
 * A server-side reader has none of that constraint: SQLite is underneath it, it
 * runs per REQUEST rather than per event, and refusing it a `WHERE` would just
 * move the query somewhere with less information. So this tier takes predicates,
 * and takes them as caller-supplied SQL (`QueryOptions`), which is why its
 * values must travel through `args` and never through interpolation.
 *
 * What both tiers share is the SCHEMA SOURCE. Rows are projected to the declared
 * columns and typed off the same declarations, so renaming a field breaks a
 * `queryCurrent` consumer exactly as it breaks a `getCurrent` one. The predicate
 * text is the one part no type can check, because it is SQL.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE GENERATION A RESPONSE WAS ANSWERED FROM
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Both views advertise `generation`: WHICH FOLD answered, as a plain field
// beside the entries. It exists for the one change no cursor check can detect.
//
//  - A promotion to a generation over the SAME stream leaves every cursor valid,
//    because a `seq` is a position in a STREAM and the stream did not move.
//  - A promotion to a generation on a DIFFERENT stream is already refused, by
//    the cursor's stream component.
//  - SAME logs, DIFFERENT fold is the case in between, and NOTHING in the
//    cursor can see it. A consumer reading state alongside the feed has to be
//    told, because its own actions may not be undoable.
//
// So this file asserts the pairing rather than the field: the value MOVES on a
// processor change while every cursor stays valid and the delivered logs stay
// byte-identical. That pairing is the whole point -- it is what makes a
// processor change FREE for a feed consumer, and it is why no generation column
// is ever added to the log table.
//
// The platform ADVERTISES and does not DICTATE. Nothing here asserts what a
// consumer should DO when the value moves: pausing, re-scanning and carrying on
// are all legitimate, and only the consumer knows whether its actions can be
// taken back.
//
// And the value is OPAQUE (the last describe below): compared, never parsed, so
// what it is composed of can change without a consumer noticing. Note that not
// one assertion in this file computes an expected value -- they are all
// relations between two answers, which is what a consumer can do too.

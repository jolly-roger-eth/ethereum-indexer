-- FIXED tables only, and every one of them lives in the reserved `_` namespace.
--
-- Entity tables are NOT here and never will be: the versioned-row state store
-- creates them at runtime from whatever entities a processor declares, so its
-- DDL is dynamic by construction. See docs/design/historical-state-database.md
-- and the state-store-sqlite package. This file is the part of the schema the
-- SERVER owns and can therefore ship as static SQL.
--
-- ## Why every name here begins with `_`
--
-- Those entity tables are created as `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "<entity>"`
-- against the SAME database handle this file's tables live in -- `buildProcessor`
-- hands one handle to both the store and the server in every combined shape --
-- so a table here whose name a processor could also declare is a SILENT
-- collision: `IF NOT EXISTS` makes the entity's DDL succeed against our table,
-- and the failure surfaces much later as a column error on a write, nowhere near
-- the declaration that caused it.
--
-- `@etherfold/state-store` already closes that by REFUSING an entity whose name
-- starts with `_` (`isReserved`, `entities.ts`), and the store's own fixed tables
-- already sit there as `_blocks` and `_cursor`. The server's are the same KIND of
-- thing, so they sit there too, and the collision becomes impossible by
-- construction rather than by a second refusal that would have to be told these
-- names. `packages/server/test/reservedNamespace.test.ts` scans this file and
-- fails if a table or index here ever forgets the prefix.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS _meta (
    key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- The version row lives HERE, in the SQL, rather than being written by the code
-- that applies it. Both application paths must produce the same database, and
-- one of them is not ours: wrangler's D1 migrations execute these files and
-- nothing else. When the version was recorded in TypeScript, a D1-migrated
-- database came up with the table present and no version row, and reported
-- itself unhealthy forever. Keep this row in step with SCHEMA_VERSION in
-- schema.ts; a test asserts they agree.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE EMISSION STREAM (ADR-0006)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The append-only log of what this server was told and what it took back: one
-- row per emitted log, retractions INCLUDED, superseded rows FLAGGED rather
-- than deleted. Nothing is ever updated here except `alive`, and nothing is
-- ever deleted. The canonical view is then a cheap derived read
-- (`WHERE alive AND blockNumber <= gate` ordered by `(blockNumber, logIndex)`)
-- and the retraction-aware feed is the same rows in `seq` order.
--
-- It is in the FIXED schema and not dynamic DDL, unlike the entity tables,
-- because two application paths must produce the SAME database and one of them
-- is wrangler's D1 migration, which executes this file and nothing else.
--
-- ## The KEY: two discriminators, both on every row
--
-- `indexer` is the NAMED INDEXER (ADR-0036), the multi-tenancy unit, which
-- arrives as the route segment a batch was posted to. `stream` is WHICH stream
-- those logs belong to, as `streamDigestOf` renders it: a wide digest over the
-- deduplicated per-entry stream hashes plus the stream config hash.
--
-- `stream` is deliberately NOT the wire context's `{source, config}`. That is a
-- 32-bit whole-entry hash kept whole on purpose (ADR-0034) as an identity check
-- between the two halves of a deployment, and it fails as a KEY twice over: a
-- decode-only change (a regenerated ABI, an added view function, a renamed
-- non-indexed parameter) moves it while the fetch filter is untouched, which
-- would orphan every row already stored; and 32 bits collide, which here means
-- one indexer silently adopting another's logs.
--
-- ## What is NOT a column, and never will be
--
-- Nothing about the PROCESSOR, and no GENERATION. The stream is keyed on
-- `{source, config}` and only the STATE on `{source, config, processor}`, so a
-- processor-only change is a new generation over the SAME stream. A column
-- carrying the processor would FORK this whole history on a processor change --
-- precisely the case the generation model promises is free.
--
-- `chainId` is not one either: it is already inside `stream`, via the block-0
-- skeleton entry that hashes the chain id, the genesis hash and each contract's
-- address and start block.
--
-- ## The raw log, and only the raw log
--
-- `address`, `topic0..topic3`, `data` and the block/transaction coordinates are
-- what the NODE said. The decoded `args` are what SOME ABI made of those bytes
-- and are re-derived on replay against the source running now, so persisting
-- them would persist an opinion that a decode-only change invalidates.

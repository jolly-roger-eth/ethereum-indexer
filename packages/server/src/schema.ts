 * query.
 *
 * Renaming the fixed tables into the reserved `_` namespace was NOT such a
 * change, which is why this still reads 2. The version row lives IN the table
 * that was renamed, so a database migrated by an older build has no `_meta` for
 * this to read and reports `applied: false` -- a stronger signal than a number
 * mismatch, and the correct one, since those tables really did change. No
 * database can hold a `_meta` row this build did not write, so version 2 there

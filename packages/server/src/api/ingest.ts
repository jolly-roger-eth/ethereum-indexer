/**
 * The log ingestion endpoint: where raw logs enter the server, and the half of
 * the wire contract that makes losing an event structurally difficult.
 *
 * ## What this layer decides, and what it only reports
 *
 * Every RULE lives in the stream-builder (`@etherfold/core`), which is where the
 * engine's own cursor check already lives. This route decides two things a
 * transport has to decide and the engine cannot:
 *
 * - **who may call it.** A caller with no token cannot advance the cursor.
 * - **which status code each refusal is.** `409` is the one and only RESUMABLE
 *   refusal: it carries `expectedFromBlock`, and a sender's whole recovery is to
 *   re-send from there. `400` is a sender that is wrong in a way no block number
 *   fixes (a foreign `{source, config}`, a malformed range, a payload that is
 *   not the range it claims). Collapsing the two would make a misconfigured
 *   fetcher retry forever against a server that will never accept it.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * No idempotency key and no dedupe table: the cursor IS the key. A re-sent batch
 * after a lost acknowledgement fails the `expectedFromBlock` check and is
 * corrected, so it cannot be applied twice.
 *
 * **And no reorg COUNTING.** This route used to own that write, which quietly
 * made an operational counter a fact about the TRANSPORT: a combined process
 * folds through `createDirectIngestion`, never reaches here, and reported no
 * reverts at all. A revert is concluded by the fold, so it is counted inside
 * `receive` through a `ReorgRecorder` the store's owner injected (ADR-0050), and
 * this route is a CALLER of that path. Counting here as well would double-count
 * the split shape, which both concludes and receives.

			 *
			 * BOTH patterns are registered on purpose, but NOT for the reason this comment
			 * used to give. It claimed the wildcard does not cover the bare path and that
			 * each registration guards half the surface; that is not true of the Hono
			 * version in use, where `/ingest/*` already answers for `/ingest` too. Removing
			 * the exact-path registration leaves the whole server suite green, so it is
			 * redundant rather than load-bearing, and the tests below cannot tell which of
			 * the two answered.
			 *
			 * It is KEPT deliberately, as belt and braces: the cost is one middleware
			 * registration, and the failure it insures against -- a routing change that
			 * narrows the wildcard and silently opens the bare path -- is exactly the kind
			 * this guard exists to make impossible. What is NOT claimed any more is that

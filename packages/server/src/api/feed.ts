/**
 * THE RETRACTION-AWARE FEED (ADR-0006, the first of the two views over the stored
 * emission stream).
 *
 * `GET /{indexer}/feed` serves the stream in `seq` order, retractions INCLUDED,
 * resuming from a cursor the CALLER holds. This is the view for a consumer that
 * WANTS to see reorgs -- it acts optimistically on a log and cancels the pending
 * action when the retraction arrives -- so nothing is filtered out of it. The
 * `alive` flag and a block gate belong to the OTHER view, which exists so that a
 * consumer never has to hear the word reorg.
 *
 * ## It is a PUBLIC read, and deliberately not behind the ingest token
 *
 * `INGEST_TOKEN` guards the FETCHER's private API -- the routes that can move the
 * cursor -- and it is registered on the ingest path for exactly that reason. A
 * consumer is a third party built outside etherfold (ADR-0005) that etherfold
 * stores nothing about, so putting the feed behind the fetcher's deployment
 * secret would mean handing every consumer the credential that can WRITE. This
 * route therefore answers anonymously, like `/status`. A deployment that needs
 * the feed private puts it behind its own edge, which is where an authorisation
 * model that knows about consumers belongs.
 *
 * ## Why this route needs the REGISTRY
 *
 * To validate a cursor's stream it must know WHICH stream is being served, and
 * the only thing that knows is the receiver registered under the name
 * (`LogIngestion.streamDigest`). The table cannot answer it: one indexer's rows
 * may span several streams over its life, nothing in them says which is current,
 * and picking one by a heuristic is the plausible wrong answer this whole design
 * refuses. So a host built with no registry answers `501` here for the same
 * reason it does on ingest -- it was built with no named indexers at all -- and
 * `etherfold serve`, the read tier, therefore does not serve this feed today.

 * refusal (re-send from `expectedFromBlock`, ADR-0004); re-using that number here
 * for something that is not resumable would make a sender's and a consumer's
 * contracts say different things with one code.
 *
 * The four are kept apart because the recovery differs, and because two of them
 * must NOT say more than they do:
 *
 * - `invalid-cursor` says nothing about WHY, on purpose. Truncated, edited,
 *   invented and written-by-an-older-build are one answer, because telling them
 *   apart would tell a client about the encoding, which is the one thing an
 *   opaque cursor must not leak.
 * - `indexer-mismatch` names the indexer the caller ADDRESSED and never the one
 *   its cursor was minted at. Echoing that back would both confirm the encoding
 *   carries a name and hand one tenant's name to a caller poking at another.
 * - `view-mismatch` is a cursor from the OTHER view, whose positions count in
 *   another space (`seq` on one side, `(blockNumber, logIndex)` on the other).
 *   Two views, one codec, and this is what keeps the shared codec from serving
 *   one view's number as the other's.
 * - `stream-mismatch` is the one that is nobody's bug, so it is the one that
 *   ANSWERS: the current stream's identity, and a cursor at the position its feed
 *   starts at. It is explicitly NOT a correction to an earlier point on the
 *   caller's own stream -- there is no fork block, because the logs a filter
 *   change produces were never on the stream the cursor names -- so re-subscribing
 *   is a decision the consumer takes rather than a step it can automate blindly.
 *   Note how that differs from the canonical view's REWIND below, which is a
 *   correction on the caller's own stream and is meant to be followed.
 *
 * ONE mapper for BOTH views, parameterised by which view is served, for the same
 * reason there is one codec: two copies would be two refusal contracts that
 * drift, and a consumer would have to learn each view's dialect of the same four
 * words.

 * REWIND TO FORK BLOCK F: the canonical view's answer to a cursor whose block is

 *
 * ## Why it is `409` and not `400`
 *
 * Every OTHER cursor refusal on this surface is a `400`, because nothing the
 * caller can do with the same cursor makes it right. This one is the exception,
 * and it is the exception for exactly the reason `409` already exists in this
 * system: ADR-0004 makes `409` the ONE RESUMABLE refusal on the ingest side --
 * "your position is not where mine is, carry on from HERE" -- and this is that
 * same sentence spoken to a consumer. Using the same number for the same meaning
 * is what keeps a sender's contract and a consumer's contract legible together;
 * `400` would file a correction the caller is MEANT to follow beside the ones it
 * must not.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a `200` carrying an instruction
 *
 * A `200` with an empty page and a rewind field beside it is indistinguishable,
 * to a consumer that ignores a field it does not know, from "you are caught up".
 * That is the silent skip in a new costume, and it is the specific failure this
 * whole validation exists to prevent, so it may not be reachable by ignoring
 * something.
 *
 * ## What it carries
 *
 * - `forkBlock` -- F, the LOWEST block the consumer must read again, and the one
 *   thing it cannot derive: it must also roll its OWN derived state back to
 *   before F, and no cursor can say that for it.
 * - `rewindCursor` -- a cursor at F, meant to be PRESENTED next. It is
 *   deliberately named to say so, unlike the stream mismatch's `startCursor`,
 *   which is a place to begin a NEW subscription and a decision a human takes.
 *   Following this one is the correct, automatic behaviour: the consumer of this
 *   view implements no reorg handling, and this is what that promise costs the
 *   server.
 * - `stream` -- the same identity the success path advertises, so a consumer
 *   logging the refusal has the whole context.
 *
 * The rewind cursor carries NO block hash, because it names a position the
 * consumer has not been served an entry at; there is nothing yet to validate,
 * and minting a hash for it would be validating a claim nobody made. It is
 * marked at the CURRENT high-water mark, so a further reorg arriving before the
 * consumer acts is still measured from here.

/**
 * The named indexer a request addressed, or the refusal to send back.
 *
 * ONE place, because both surfaces that take a `/{indexer}` segment -- the
 * fetcher's private INGEST routes and the public FEED -- have to answer the same
 * two questions the same way, and two copies would drift into two contracts.
 *
 * TWO refusals, and keeping them apart is the point of doing this here:
 *
 * - **`501`, no registry at all.** This host was built with no named indexers --
 *   a read tier, or a combined process whose ingestion is the in-process direct
 *   wire -- so there is no name it could answer under, in either direction. It is
 *   a CAPABILITY statement, and it is what the ingest routes have always said
 *   when nothing was injected.
 * - **`404`, a name this host was not built with.** A ROUTING refusal, matching
 *   what the name IS: a route segment. It is deliberately not a `400`, because
 *   ADR-0004's `400` family is about the PAYLOAD (a foreign `{source, config}`,
 *   a malformed range) and nothing is wrong with this payload; and deliberately
 *   not a `409`, because no block number makes it right. A sender must not retry
 *   either of them, which is what `createHttpIngestion` does with the whole 4xx
 *   family bar the `409`.
 *
 * What it is NEVER is a default. Falling back to "the only indexer this host
 * has" would make a typo in a fetcher's configuration land another tenant's logs
 * in a database that will never be able to tell, and would let a consumer follow
 * a feed it did not ask for.

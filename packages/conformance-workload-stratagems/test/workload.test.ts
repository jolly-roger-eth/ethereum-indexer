/**
 * The FAST half of the workload: the abandoned early deployment, on every
 * backend, on every test invocation.
 *
 * 42 events over 9 blocks, which is small enough that a failure is a readable
 * diff and quick enough that nobody is tempted to skip it. It exercises the same
 * processor, the same projection and the same golden-state comparison as the
 * launched game does in `alpha1.test.ts`, so a mistake in the shared machinery
 * surfaces here first, in seconds, rather than in a run over 31,332 events.
 *
 * What it does NOT cover is what makes the launched game the workload: the
 * reward handlers (they do not exist in this deployment's contracts), the
 * placement window ever overflowing, and the reorg case. That is the split, and
 * `alpha1.test.ts` says how the other half runs.

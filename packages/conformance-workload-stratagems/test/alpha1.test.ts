/**
 * The workload itself: the LAUNCHED stratagems game on Base, every backend.
 *
 * 31,332 real logs over 1,042 event-bearing blocks, replayed through the ported
 * processor and compared against the state the ORIGINAL `JSProcessor` computed
 * from the same bytes. This is the case the whole fixture exists for, and it is
 * the one a hand-written case cannot stand in for: ten of thirteen handlers
 * fire, the placement window takes 100 arrivals and keeps 7 (so the eviction
 * cascade runs 93 times), and 16,046 of the events write nothing but u256 fields.
 *
 * ## Fast versus full, and which backends
 *
 * It is NOT in the default loop, because it is half a minute rather than one
 * second and a loop nobody runs is worse than a slower one.
 * `test/workload.test.ts` is the fast smoke case and runs on every invocation;
 * this runs in CI (where `CI` is set) and on demand as `test:full`.
 *
 * IndexedDB is in the fast case and NOT in this one by default, and the reason
 * is the shim rather than the backend: on `fake-indexeddb` this replay costs
 * about half an hour and degrades quadratically with the stored version count,
 * where the same backend measured 45.6 ms/block on real Chromium (so under a
 * minute for the whole stream) in `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md`.
 * Half an hour on every pull request would be disabled by the next person to
 * wait for it, so it is opt-in as `STRATAGEMS_WORKLOAD=all`, the observation is
 * recorded in `work/notes/observations/fake-indexeddb-write-cost-grows-quadratically.md`,
 * and the honest route to heavy-workload coverage on that backend is the real
 * engine (`packages/state-store-indexeddb/browser/`) rather than a faster shim.
 *
 * A diff on the golden state is not a fixture to update. It means the processor
 * changed meaning, and that is a finding.

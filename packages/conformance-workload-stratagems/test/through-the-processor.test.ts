/**
 * The workload driven through the shipped `EventProcessor`, not through a store
 * directly.
 *
 * `workload.test.ts` and `alpha1.test.ts` feed `replayIntoStore`, which composes
 * `forkPoint` / `groupByBlock` / `runBlockHandlers` / `applyBlock` itself so it
 * can keep the id LEDGER the projection needs. That is legitimate and it is not
 * the whole claim: a deployment does not call those, it hands a store and a
 * processor to `EntityEventProcessor` and lets the core drive `load` / `process`.
 * If those two paths could disagree, the golden state would be evidence about a
 * path nobody ships.
 *
 * So this runs the same fixture BOTH ways on the same backend and asserts they
 * land on the same state -- and that the state is still the one the ORIGINAL
 * stratagems `JSProcessor` computed, so "the same" is not "the same wrong". The
 * ledger comes from the replay run, which is what makes the comparison possible
 * at all: the seam has no unanchored "list everything" read and deliberately
 * never will (ADR-0021), so something has to know which business keys were
 * written.
 *
 * The fast fixture only. This is a question about the SHELL -- the cursor, the
 * lifecycle, the delegation -- and the shell does not get more interesting at
 * 31,332 events; what does is the processor, which `alpha1.test.ts` already asks
 * about on every backend.

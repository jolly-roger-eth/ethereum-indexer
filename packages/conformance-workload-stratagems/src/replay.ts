/**
 * Replay a captured stream through the ported processor into a store, and
 * remember which entities it touched.
 *
 * The replay itself is `@etherfold/processor-entities` doing what it does for
 * any deployment: revert once at the fork point, then one block, one
 * `runBlockHandlers`, one `applyBlock`. Nothing here is a test harness's private
 * path -- that is the point of promoting the workload rather than keeping a
 * bespoke runner beside it.
 *
 * What IS here is the id LEDGER, and it exists because the seam has no "list
 * everything" read and deliberately never will: a listing is anchored at a key
 * by construction (ADR-0021), so an unanchored scan is not expressible. To
 * compare a whole state against a golden file, something has to know which
 * business keys the run wrote, and the mutations already say so exactly. Reading
 * each of them back through `getCurrent` afterwards is a STRONGER check than
 * enumerating live rows would be, because a key the processor DELETED must come
 * back `undefined`: a backend that leaves a deleted row live fails on the same
 * comparison as one that loses a written row.

/**
 * The stratagems state, declared as entities, on the IDIOMATIC model.
 *
 * This is a REWRITE of the port measured in `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md`,
 * not a copy of it. That port was written before `MutationContext` had a
 * listing, so its ordered bounded array cost three entities plus a
 * hand-maintained CSV of positions, a `playerCount` per cell and a singleton
 * holding the arrival order (contortions 1 and 2 of the finding). With the
 * bounded id-prefix listing (ADR-0021) all four of those disappear, and the
 * proof that the rewrite did not change MEANING is that it still lands on the
 * byte-identical golden state the ORIGINAL `JSProcessor` computed on Base.
 *
 * What that fix is made of, in two modelling rules:
 *
 * 1. **Children are their own entity keyed by their parent, and the collection
 *    is DERIVED WHEN READ** -- the shape The Graph's `@derivedFrom` describes.
 *    Nothing is maintained at write time, so appending costs one row.
 * 2. **Ordered children are keyed by something naturally unique, never by a
 *    dense array position.** Here that key is ARRIVAL: `(blockNumber, logIndex)`
 *    of the event, fixed-width so the id's own lexicographic order IS the
 *    numeric one. The old port's hand-maintained count existed only because the
 *    child's id ended in an array index.
 *
 * Two contortions in the finding do NOT disappear, and they are documented on
 * the declarations below rather than smoothed over: `cellOwner` (a scalar map
 * needs its own entity, because `set` writes a WHOLE row) and the u256 fields
 * (there is no column type for them, so they are decimal TEXT read back through
 * `BigInt()`).

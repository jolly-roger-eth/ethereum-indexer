/**
 * The conformance WORKLOAD: a real launched processor, its real captured event
 * stream, and the state the ORIGINAL processor computed from it, run against
 * whichever backend a factory hands over.
 *
 * A workload is a SUBJECT fed to the conformance suite's question, not a second
 * suite (ADR-0020). `@etherfold/state-store-conformance` asks a backend small,
 * hand-written questions whose failures are readable; this asks the one question
 * a hand-written case cannot ask, which is whether 31,332 real events out of a
 * launched game still land on the state that game's own processor computed.
 *
 * Three properties make it worth the fixture's weight:
 *
 * - **The expected state is not ours.** It was computed by the stratagems
 *   `JSProcessor` (commit `3d5a0b3f`), which is the code that has actually been
 *   running on Base. An expected value we wrote ourselves would prove nothing.
 *   It is FROZEN rather than recomputable: the driver that could re-run that
 *   processor went with the free-form authoring path (ADR-0037), so what is
 *   compared against is the committed file.
 * - **The input is fixed.** No node is in the loop: the stream is a committed
 *   capture with its provenance, so two backends cannot be compared on different
 *   bytes and a rerun a year from now sees the same events.
 * - **It is big enough to be surprising.** Ten of thirteen handlers fire, the
 *   placement window takes 100 arrivals and keeps 7, so the eviction cascade runs
 *   93 times; 16,046 of the events write nothing but u256 fields; and the revert
 *   case is a real accumulated counter going back DOWN.

/**
 * The stratagems processor, as an `EntityProcessor` over `MutationContext`.
 *
 * DERIVED WORK of github.com/wighawag/stratagems `indexer/src/index.ts`
 * @ 3d5a0b3f (GPL-3.0); see `../vendor/stratagems/README.md`. What it is checked
 * against is the state that file computed, committed under `../fixtures/`.
 *
 * Read this next to `../vendor/stratagems/js-processor.ts`. Handlers that touch
 * flat keyed maps (`onCommitmentMade`, the reward handlers, the pokes) port
 * across almost unchanged. `onCommitmentRevealed` is the interesting one,
 * because it is where an ordered bounded array with a cascade lives, and it is
 * the handler this promotion REWROTE.
 *
 * ## What the rewrite removed, and what pays for it
 *
 * The measured port in `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md` predates
 * the bounded id-prefix listing. Without a way to ask "which rows belong to this
 * parent", it had to write the answer down: a `placement.positions` CSV so the
 * cascade had something to walk, a `placementCell.playerCount` so an append knew
 * which index to write at, and a `placementWindow` singleton holding the arrival
 * order. Three maintained indexes, and one `pop()` became an O(cells x players)
 * loop of manual deletes against a foreign key the store could not answer in the
 * direction needed. That path is not hypothetical: on the real stream the window
 * takes 100 arrivals and keeps 7, so the cascade runs 93 times.
 *
 * Here the window is `state.list('placement', {window: WINDOW}, 8)` and the
 * cascade is `state.list('placementPlayer', {ordinal}, ...)`. Nothing is
 * maintained at write time, the arrival order IS the key, and the entity count
 * went from six to three for the same state. The golden state is what says the
 * meaning survived: this processor lands on the byte-identical output the
 * ORIGINAL `JSProcessor` computed on Base.

 * the DATA: the children of an arrival are a prefix listing under it, so there
 * is no second copy of the membership to keep in step.
 *
 * It pages rather than asking once with a big limit, and the paging is the
 * point: a listing that was `truncated` and got treated as the whole collection
 * is exactly how a cascade leaves orphans behind silently. Deleting a page is
 * visible to the next listing through read-your-writes, so the loop makes
 * progress within the block and stops when the prefix is empty.

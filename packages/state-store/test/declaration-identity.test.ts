/**
 * When two names are TWO NAMES, which is the half of the identifier rule that is
 * about identity rather than about spelling.
 *
 * The shape rule (`IDENTIFIER`, tested through the store constructors) asks
 * whether a name may be interpolated at all. This asks a different question, and
 * it is the question the backends disagreed about: `token` and `Token` are one
 * table on SQLite -- which folds identifier case even inside quotes, so the
 * keyword fix does not reach it -- and two entities on the memory, patch and
 * IndexedDB backends. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Token"` matched the existing
 * `token` and was silently SKIPPED, after which `getCurrent('Token', ...)`
 * answered with `token`'s row
 * (`work/notes/observations/entity-names-differing-only-in-case-collide-on-sqlite.md`).
 *
 * No DDL makes the two engines agree, so the answer cannot be a backend's: the
 * declaration is refused, everywhere, where it was written. That is why THIS
 * rule sits at the seam when the SQL reserved-word list deliberately does not
 * (see the module note in `src/entities.ts`).

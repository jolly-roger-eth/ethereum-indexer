/**
 * The guard that makes "as of WHAT" a question with only two answers.
 *
 * A historical read has exactly two honest outcomes: the row that was live then,
 * or a refusal saying the store cannot answer about that block. `undefined` is a
 * third thing and it means something else entirely -- the block is fine and the
 * entity was absent from it -- so an `at` that is not a block number at all must
 * never reach the version predicate, where it would compare unequal to every
 * range and come back as an ordinary absence.
 *
 * The check lives at the seam, next to `assertRetained` and inside it, because
 * every backend whose `getAsOf` takes a NUMBER already routes through that one
 * call. A backend with an addressing layer above it (`@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`
 * takes a height, a `{hash}` or a `{timestamp}`) resolves first and hands a
 * resolved number down, so the guard constrains it exactly as much as it should:
 * not at all.

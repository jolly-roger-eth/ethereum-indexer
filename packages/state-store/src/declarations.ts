/**
 * The declaration, read as TYPES: one description of the data, for storage AND
 * for reads.
 *
 * `{name, id, fields}` already drives the layout, the versions, the as-of read
 * and the revert. What lives here is the other half of the same object: the
 * shape of a row, of a business key and of a listing prefix, DERIVED from the
 * declaration rather than written a second time next to it. A consumer that
 * hand-wrote `type Token = {id: string; owner: string}` would own a second
 * description that drifts silently the day a field is renamed; derived, the
 * rename stops the consumer compiling.
 *
 * ## Nothing here decodes anything
 *
 * A field's TypeScript type is the declared storage class and nothing more:
 * `text` is a `string`, and if that string is the decimal form of a `uint256`
 * this surface still hands back the string. It cannot do otherwise, because the
 * declaration has no way to SAY a text column is a u256 (`FieldType` is
 * `text | integer | real | blob`, the intersection of what the backends hold).
 * Decoding on a guess -- "text that parses as digits is a BigInt" -- is exactly
 * the ambiguity `tagged-bigint-codec-across-storage-adapters` exists to remove
 * elsewhere in this repo. See ADR-0025.
 *
 * ## Why a helper rather than `as const`
 *
 * `declareEntities` is an identity function whose only job is to keep the
 * literals. An ANNOTATED declaration (`const TOKEN: EntityDeclaration = ...`)
 * widens `'owner'` to `string` and `'text'` to `FieldType`, after which nothing
 * can be derived; `as const` keeps them but says nothing about validity. This
 * keeps them AND checks the shape where it is written.
 */

/**
 * Pin the literal types of a set of declarations, and check their shape.
 *
 * The value is unchanged and is still an ordinary `readonly EntityDeclaration[]`,
 * so the SAME array goes to the store's constructor, to a processor's `entities`
 * and to `createReadSurface`. That is the point: one array, one description.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const entities = declareEntities([{name: 'token', id: 'id', fields: {owner: 'text'}}]);
 * const store = new MemoryStateStore(entities);

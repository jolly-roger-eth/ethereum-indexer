/**
 * ## Starting from state somebody else computed, without claiming their history
 *
 * A client that replays the chain from the start block pays for every log the
 * contract ever emitted. A client that BOOTSTRAPS downloads the rows another
 * indexer already computed, installs them with the cursor that belongs to them,
 * and carries on from there. The free-form path has had this since it existed
 * (`keepStateOnIndexedDB(name, remote)` in `@etherfold/browser`, and the CLI's
 * file envelope); this is the same capability for the entity path, where the
 * contents are versioned rows rather than one blob.
 *
 * ## The trap, which is the whole reason this module is careful
 *
 * A snapshot of CURRENT rows carries **no history below the block it was taken
 * at**. Install it into a freshly migrated store and the store will happily go
 * on reporting `unbounded`, because that is true of a store that has been
 * indexing since genesis and it has no way to know it is not one. It would then
 * answer `getAsOf(entity, id, snapshotBlock - 1_000)` with `undefined` -- "the
 * entity was absent then" -- which is an ordinary answer a caller acts on
 * normally, and which is WRONG. That is the plausible-wrong-number failure the
 * retention capability exists to prevent, arriving through a door nobody was
 * watching.
 *
 * So a bootstrapped store's floor comes FROM the snapshot, and it is expressed
 * in the retention vocabulary that already exists rather than in a parallel one:
 * the honest report is a WINDOW whose oldest block is the snapshot's, the
 * refusal below it is `BlockNotRetainedError`, and a store that answers no
 * historical read at all (`revert-only`) is left saying exactly that.
 *
 * ## Why a wrapper and not a verb on every backend
 *
 * The obligation is identical on all of them -- refuse below the floor, report
 * the floor, refuse a revert that reaches under it -- and it is expressible
 * entirely through the seam a backend already implements: the rows install as
 * ONE `applyBlock` at the snapshot's block, and the floor persists through the
 * cursor port. Writing it once here means a new backend inherits it rather than
 * rediscovering the trap, which is precisely what the conformance suite asks of
 * it (`snapshot-bootstrap.ts` there runs these properties against every
 * backend).
 *
 * ## What a snapshot contains: CURRENT ROWS, and that is a decision
 *
 * See ADR-0028. The short of it is that history is roughly seven times the
 * current state on the real measured workload (4,072 live rows against 29,393
 * versions, `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md`) while the whole
 * gzipped event stream is 0.6 MB, so a snapshot carrying full history
 * approaches the cost of just replaying the stream -- and, decisively, a
 * version range is not something the seam can install: a version is what
 * applying a block PRODUCES, and a write surface that could set `_lower` and
 * `_upper` directly could manufacture states no sequence of blocks could reach.
 * Current rows install as one ordinary block, through the verb every backend
 * already has.

/**
 * The store handle a deployment that MAY start from a snapshot uses -- on every

 * the contents came from, and it makes every read and every revert respect that
 * floor. A store that was never bootstrapped is a pass-through, reporting
 * whatever the store underneath reports.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const store = await openSnapshotAware(await createBrowserStateStore(processor.entities));
 * await store.bootstrap(snapshot, {processor: eventProcessor.getVersionHash()});
 * ```
 *
 * A host that fetches its snapshot from published mirrors, and that wants "only
 * if this store has never synced" decided for it, uses `openAndBootstrap` in
 * `@etherfold/processor-entities` instead: knowing how far the local store has
 * got means reading `lastToBlock` out of a cursor, and the cursor is an opaque
 * string here on purpose (ADR-0027).
 *
 * ## The tip it measures a window from
 *
 * A window is a distance from the tip, and the seam has no verb that reports
 * one, so this handle tracks the highest block it has seen: the snapshot's when
 * it opens, and each applied block after that. The FLOOR -- the number a caller
 * acts on, and the one a read is refused at -- is exact either way, because it
 * is the snapshot's block and not a distance. What is approximate is the width
 * REPORTED between a reload and the first block applied in that session: a store
 * that indexed a thousand blocks past its snapshot, was reloaded, and has not
 * yet applied a block reports a narrower window than it can actually answer.
 * That is the safe direction (it claims LESS than it holds, never more) and it
 * corrects itself on the first `applyBlock`.

/**
 * The seam: what a store must do for a processor to run on it.
 *
 * Eleven verbs and one report, chosen because they are the whole of what
 * processing a chain needs and because each of them is cheaply implementable on
 * every substrate we have measured (versioned SQL rows, an object store, an
 * in-memory map, a patch log). Anything a particular backend can do BETTER stays
 * on that backend's own class: `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite` keeps a richer
 * query surface (`queryCurrent` / `queryAsOf`, with caller-supplied SQL) and
 * block addressing by hash and time, because a server has a query planner and a
 * handler does not.
 *
 * The direction of the constraint is what makes this work: the mutation surface
 * a handler writes through is the MORE constrained one, so a freer substrate can
 * implement it, while backing arbitrary nested object mutation with versioned
 * rows cannot be done without materialising the store.
 *
 * The listing is the one SET read, and its BOUND is what keeps it cheap
 * everywhere: a prefix of the declared id plus a required limit, never a
 * predicate and never a caller-supplied ordering (see `listing.ts`).
 *
 * Deliberately absent, and each absence is a decision:
 *
 * - **Block addressing by hash or time.** `getAsOf` takes a resolved block
 *   NUMBER, so the seam owes nothing to a block table. Resolving a hash or a
 *   timestamp to a number, and refusing an address that resolves to nothing
 *   (`NoSuchBlockError`, ADR-0015), is the read layer above.
 *
 * Present, and it USED to be on that list: **the sync cursor**. It was left out
 * on the grounds that where a processor keeps `LastSync` is the processor
 * package's business (ADR-0016), which is true of the MEANING and turned out to
 * be the wrong conclusion about the STORAGE. A cursor kept outside the store is
 * a second round trip after the block it describes, and a crash in that window
 * wedges the indexer for good. Only the store holds the transaction, so only the
 * store can close it -- and the cost is a handful of lines per backend over one
 * key and one opaque string, which is what keeps ADR-0016 intact: the store
 * still does not know what a `LastSync` is. See `cursor.ts`.

	 * what this adds is the other half, bounding the BYTES. It is deliberately not
	 * a side effect of `applyBlock`, because a prune costs real time (1.1 s at
	 * 62,553 versions, measured in
	 * `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md`) and a block carries a median
	 * of 7 mutations, so folding it in would stall whichever block happened to
	 * cross a threshold by a second for work that block did not ask for. Which
	 * block pays, and how often, is the host's scheduling decision, and a store is
	 * the wrong place to invent one. An amortised policy is `maxVersions` on a

	 * The caller is the writer: a store has one, and pruning between blocks is safe
	 * exactly where applying a block is.
	 *
	 * Pruning a store that has no floor to prune at (`unbounded`, or `revert-only`
	 * with no declared finality depth) is a NO-OP and never an error: "keep
	 * everything" is a legitimate answer to "drop what is unreachable", and a host
	 * that prunes on a timer must not have to ask what it is holding first.
	 *
	 * The LIVE version of an entity is never dropped, however old it is. A row
	 * written once at block 12,082,307 and never touched again is still the current

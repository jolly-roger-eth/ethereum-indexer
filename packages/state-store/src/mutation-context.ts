/**
 * The write surface a handler gets for ONE block.

 * `get` is read-your-writes WITHIN the block being processed: it answers from
 * the mutations already staged for this block, and falls through to the store's
 * current state otherwise. That matters because a handler that increments a
 * counter must see the value an earlier event in the same block wrote, which is
 * the behaviour the in-memory path gets for free by mutating one object. It is
 * load-bearing rather than theoretical: on the real stratagems stream, 16,871 of
 * 66,113 reads were served from the block's own staging area.
 *
 * Blocks below the one being processed are always already flushed, because a
 * block is applied before the next block's handlers run: one block is exactly
 * one atomic unit. So `get` never has to reason about more than the current
 * block.
 *
 * Reads are uniformly async, on every backend. The alternative, typing them as
 * `T | Promise<T>`, is infectious at every call site for the benefit of saving a
 * microtask on a path whose cost is dominated by fetching logs.

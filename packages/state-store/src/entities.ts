/**
 * Validation of a declaration, once, for every backend.
 *
 * The rule is set by the STRICTEST backend and applied uniformly, which is the
 * only arrangement under which "this declaration is valid" is a fact about the
 * declaration rather than about the deployment. A SQL store interpolates entity
 * and field names into DDL, because SQL cannot bind an identifier as a
 * parameter, so it needs names it can trust; an object-store backend would
 * happily take anything. If each backend validated to its own taste, a
 * declaration would be accepted in a browser and fatal on a server, which is
 * exactly the failure `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md` recorded.
 *
 * The rule is a SHAPE rule, and it deliberately does not know about SQL KEYWORDS.
 * `index`, `order`, `group` and the rest have ordinary identifier shapes, and
 * refusing them here would push one engine's reserved-word list into the surface
 * every backend shares, break declarations that are legal today, and re-open the
 * hole the day a second SQL backend arrives with a different list. A SQL backend
 * QUOTES what it interpolates instead (`identifiers.ts` in
 * `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`), so it accepts exactly what this function
 * accepts. That agreement is asserted for every backend by the
 * `a declaration means the same thing on every backend` group of
 * `@etherfold/state-store-conformance`.
 *
 * ## Why CASE is refused here when a keyword list is not
 *
 * The two look contradictory side by side, and they are not. A keyword list is
 * one engine's VOCABULARY: `index` is a word SQLite happens to have taken, it
 * means nothing to a key-value store, and quoting removes the problem entirely,
 * so the list has no business being at a surface every backend shares.
 *
 * Case is not vocabulary, it is IDENTITY. `token` and `Token` are two names
 * asking whether they are two THINGS, and the backends disagree about the
 * answer: SQLite folds identifier case (quoted or not -- quoting does not help
 * here the way it helps with a keyword), so it stores one table, while the
 * memory, patch and IndexedDB backends key by the exact string and store two
 * entities. There is no spelling of the DDL that makes SQLite keep them apart,
 * so the choice is not "where does the workaround go" but "which answer is the
 * declaration's", and the only answer that is the same everywhere is: two names
 * a backend could confuse are ONE name, and declaring both is a mistake.
 *
 * The rule is therefore a PORTABILITY rule -- it exists because the backends
 * disagree -- rather than one engine's vocabulary, which is why it lives at the
 * seam and the keyword list does not.
 *
 * Its ASCII-only companion falls out of `IDENTIFIER` for free: a name may not
 * contain a non-ASCII character at all, so there is no pair of identifiers that
 * are equal only after NFC/NFD normalisation (the same collision SHAPE as case),
 * and `fold` below has no dotted I and no eszett to get wrong. That is not an
 * accident of the regex; it is the reason the regex stays ASCII-only.

/**
 * The `_` prefix means NOT A USER ENTITY: a version column, or a FIXED table

 *
 * It is deliberately not "the store's", because two packages put tables there.
 * The store's own are `_blocks` and `_cursor` (`@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`),
 * and the indexer-server's are `_meta` and `_emissions`, which share ONE database
 * handle with the entity tables in every combined shape. An entity named after
 * one of those would have been created as `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "<name>"`
 * against the existing table, succeeded silently, and failed much later as a
 * column error on a write.
 *
 * The namespace is what closes that, and it closes it WITHOUT this package
 * learning anything about the packages composed above it: the rule stays "a name
 * starting with `_` is not yours", and a fixed table earns its protection by
 * being named inside it. Parameterising the reserved set so a host declares its
 * own fixed names was considered and refused: it grows optional API here for a
 * guard that is off by default (a browser uses this store with no server at all)
 * and relocates the discipline rather than removing it.

/**
 * ## The read surface, generated from the entity declarations
 *
 * A consumer reads state by naming an ENTITY and its DECLARED columns:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const entities = declareEntities([{name: 'token', id: 'id', fields: {owner: 'text'}}]);
 * const surface = createReadSurface(store, entities);
 *
 * const token = await surface.token.getCurrent({id: '1'}); // {id: string; owner: string | null} | undefined
 * ```
 *
 * There is no table name and no column string anywhere in that, which is the
 * point: the declaration that drives the storage is the same object that types
 * the read, so a consumer never writes -- and never maintains -- a second
 * description of the data. Rename `owner` in the declaration and the line above
 * stops COMPILING, instead of returning `undefined` in production.
 *
 * ## Why this tier is bounded, and where the unbounded one lives
 *
 * These are the seam's four reads and no more: by id at the tip, by id as of a
 * block, and the bounded listing (a PREFIX of the declared id plus a REQUIRED
 * limit) in both flavours. No predicate, no caller-supplied ordering, no offset.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate and it is about WHERE THE CALLER RUNS. This tier
 * is the one a handler is held to, and a handler runs once per event on every
 * backend, including the ones with no query planner, so it gets the one shape
 * that is an indexed range scan everywhere (ADR-0021). A SERVER-side reader has
 * a planner underneath it and no per-event budget, so it may take predicates:
 * that is `createQuerySurface` in `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`, which adds
 * `queryCurrent` / `queryAsOf` to exactly these four and types their rows off
 * the same declarations. Two tiers, one schema source.
 *
 * ## Errors stay errors
 *
 * Nothing here catches anything. A block address that resolves to no block
 * throws `NoSuchBlockError` (ADR-0015), a historical read outside a backend's
 * retention throws `BlockNotRetainedError` (ADR-0019), and both travel out of
 * this surface untouched. `undefined` keeps its one meaning: the block is known
 * and the entity was absent from it.
 *
 * ## What a GraphQL layer would do with this
 *
 * Nothing in here ships GraphQL, and nothing in here has to change for it to be
 * added. The decided stack (Hono, then Yoga, then Pothos, built
 * programmatically, no SDL and no deploy-time codegen) builds its object types
 * by walking the SAME `declareEntities` array -- a field per declared column,
 * `FieldValue` giving the scalar -- and resolves each one through the surface
 * below: `getCurrent` for a node, `listCurrent` for a `@derivedFrom`-style
 * child collection, `getAsOf` / `listAsOf` for a block argument. It is an
 * ADDITION over this surface rather than a refactor of it, which is the property
 * this task exists to guarantee.
 */

/**
 * The block address this surface's as-of reads take: whatever ITS STORE takes.
 *
 * The seam's `getAsOf` takes a resolved block NUMBER, so a surface over a plain
 * `StateStore` takes a number. Addressing by hash or by time is a read layer a
 * BACKEND adds above the seam (`@etherfold/state-store-sqlite` accepts
 * `{hash}` / `{timestamp}` / a height, ADR-0015), and a surface over that store
 * accepts all three, because this type reads the parameter off the store it was
 * handed.
 *
 * So a hash passed to a store that cannot resolve one is a COMPILE error rather
 * than a run-time surprise, and no capability has to be re-declared here to say
 * so: the store's own signature already says it.

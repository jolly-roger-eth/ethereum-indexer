/**
 * A read about a block this store cannot answer for.
 *
 * The family ADR-0015 opened: "there is no such block" and "that block is known
 * and the entity was absent from it" are different news and must not arrive in
 * the same shape, so the unanswerable case is an ERROR and the absent case is
 * `undefined`. Its members are distinguishable by type and each carries what it
 * needs to say what went wrong:
 *
 * - `NoSuchBlockError` (`@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`): the ADDRESS resolves to
 *   no recorded block, because it was never indexed or has been reorged out.
 * - `BlockNotRetainedError` (here): the block is a perfectly good block, and the
 *   store no longer keeps -- or never keeps -- the versions needed to answer
 *   about it.
 *
 * The base exists so a caller that only wants to know "my historical read did
 * not happen" can catch one thing, while a caller that must distinguish a reorg
 * from a retention boundary still can. It lives at the seam because the second
 * member is thrown by every backend, and two classes of one name in two packages
 * would break `instanceof` across the boundary.
 *
 * What is NOT a member, deliberately: `InvalidBlockNumberError` below. Every
 * member of this family is a fact about the store; that one is a fact about the
 * call, and no retention setting makes a non-block answerable.

/**
 * Thrown by a read whose `at` is not a block number at all.
 *
 * **Deliberately not a member of `BlockUnavailableError`, and that is the whole
 * decision.** Every member of that family is a fact about the STORE: the block
 * is real, and this store cannot answer about it. A caller acts on one by
 * widening retention, re-pinning, or telling a user their pinned block is gone.
 * This one is a fact about the CALL: `{hash: '0x64'}`, `'100'` or `undefined`
 * names no block, so there is no store configuration under which it becomes
 * answerable and nothing to catch it for. It is a programmer error, so it is a
 * `TypeError`, and a caller that catches `BlockUnavailableError` to handle "my
 * historical read did not happen" does not swallow it.
 *
 * It is also not `undefined`, which is the answer this guard exists to prevent:
 * a non-number `at` compares unequal to every version range, so without the
 * guard the read matches nothing and returns the ordinary "the entity was absent
 * then" -- a plausible answer to a question nobody asked.
 *
 * A backend with an addressing layer above the seam resolves its address to a
 * block number first (`@etherfold/state-store-sqlite` takes a height, a `{hash}`
 * or a `{timestamp}`), and throws this for the HEIGHT axis for the same reason:
 * a height that is not a whole non-negative number is not a block either. An
 * address that resolves to no recorded block is the other thing entirely, and
 * stays `NoSuchBlockError`.

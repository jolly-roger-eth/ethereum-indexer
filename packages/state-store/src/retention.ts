/**
 * ## Retention, from the deployment's side
 *
 * `Retention` (in `capabilities.ts`) is what a store REPORTS. This module is the
 * other half: what a deployment SETS, how it is validated, and what a read that
 * falls outside it gets back.
 *
 * The two are deliberately not the same type. A setting is a request, and a
 * store reports what it can actually provide, so a store that cannot enforce
 * what it was asked for reports what it does instead of what it was told.
 *
 * The third piece is `retentionFloor` and `prune`: the window bounds what a READ
 * may ask about at all times (`assertRetained`), and pruning is what makes it
 * bound the BYTES as well. The two halves share one comparison, deliberately, so
 * that no backend can refuse a read at one boundary and delete rows at another.
 */

/**
 * What a deployment writes: a distance in BLOCK NUMBERS, or one of the two ends.
 *
 * The window is `{blocks: N}` and not a bare `N`, because a bare number names no
 * unit and this surface has exactly one. It is also not `{seconds}`, `{days}` or
 * `{updates}`, and those are rejected loudly rather than ignored (see
 * `resolveRetention`).
 *
 * **Choosing N is not choosing a number of updates.** On the real measured
 * stream (the launched stratagems game on Base) event-bearing blocks are median
 * **429 blocks apart**, so a window of 64 blocks holds exactly ONE event-bearing
 * block, and reading "64 blocks" as "64 updates of history" is wrong by orders
 * of magnitude on any sparse contract. Size a window against the chain's block
 * rate and the contract's activity, not against how much history it feels like.

 *   while the tip stands still. (Time is already solved on the READ side, where

 * - **A count of updates** is refused because it is derivable, not a second
 *   mode: every backend already indexes the blocks that changed something, so
 *   "the last N updates" resolves to a floor BLOCK NUMBER above the seam and the
 *   one enforcement path does the rest.
 *

 * drifting; and it comes FIRST, before the store's own claim is consulted,

 * is not a block, `-1` is not a block, and `'100'` is a string that compares
 * unequal to every one of them rather than a block written differently. A store
 * that let any of them through would answer the read with an empty match, which
 * reads as "the entity was absent then".
 *
 * It is exported because the addressing layer above the seam asks the same
 * question of its HEIGHT axis (`@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`), and one rule
 * spelled twice is a rule that drifts.

 * through, so the check is written once and inherited rather than copied into
 * each backend and left to drift. A backend with an addressing layer above it
 * resolves first and hands a number down, so this constrains it not at all.

 * Read `blockTimestamp` off a log into seconds since the epoch.
 *
 * The timestamp comes from the log itself (`blockTimestamp`, standardised in
 * `execution-apis#639`, served by current clients), so addressing by time needs
 * no extra block-by-number round-trip. It arrives inconsistently encoded: the
 * spec says a QUANTITY is 0x-prefixed hex, and at least one client returned it
 * in decimal.
 *
 * The prefix is the ONLY signal, and the ambiguity is not recoverable without
 * it: `'1705366720'` is a valid hex string as well as a valid decimal one, and
 * the two readings are ~2,300 years apart. So `0x` means hex, bare digits mean
 * decimal, and anything else throws rather than defaulting to 0 (a timestamp of
 * 0 would sort before every block and quietly poison time addressing).
 *
 * This lives at the seam because `BlockPointer.timestamp` is where the numeric
 * contract is defined. The ingestion side calls it once, when it turns a log
 * into a `BlockPointer`, rather than re-deriving the same rule.

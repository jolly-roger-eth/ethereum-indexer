/**
 * How a host schedules a fetcher: a LOOP, driven by whoever owns the process.
 *
 * It is HERE, above `@etherfold/core` and below the adapter, because scheduling
 * is the only thing a host adds and `@etherfold/core` must name no scheduler
 * (ADR-0003, and a test in core reads the sources to keep it that way).
 *
 * It names no runtime: `setTimeout` is all it needs, so an adapter contributes a
 * process, its signals and an exit code, and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why there is only one shape
 *
 * An earlier version of this file also carried `runBoundedFetcherRun`, the shape
 * a host that gets an INVOCATION would use. It is gone because no host in this
 * design can use it. Driving the chain needs a process that can sit in a loop:
 * a serverless trigger fires on a schedule at best once a minute, caps an
 * invocation well below what a first sync takes, and holds a whole batch in
 * memory while it works. That is why the serverless runtime here hosts the
 * RECEIVING half, where the work is per-request and short, and the fetching half
 * runs somewhere that can hold a process, whether it pushes over HTTP or feeds a
 * stream-builder in the same process (`createDirectIngestion`, `@etherfold/core`).
 *
 * Keeping the bounded shape around for a host nobody expects to build would have
 * been a speculative export with a real cost: another public function, another
 * set of outcomes on `RunSummary`, and a test suite asserting two shapes agree
 * when only one of them can ever run. It is about forty lines, and it can come
 * back the day an invocation-scoped host with a workable budget does.

 * Drive cycles until stopped: the shape a host that can hold a process uses.

 * It follows the tip continuously, which in practice means it spends a first
 * sync running cycles back to back (each `progress` report that has not reached
 * the tip is followed by `catchUpDelayMs`, zero by default) and then settles
 * into one cycle per `pollIntervalMs`. Anything that is not progress backs off
 * on the curve `delayFor` computes.
 *
 * A refusal ENDS the loop, and there is deliberately no option to carry on past
 * one. A bad token, a foreign `{source, config}` or a provider on the wrong chain
 * does not become right by being tried again, so a "keep going anyway" switch
 * could only ever produce the failure the two refusal codes exist to prevent: a
 * host that looks healthy while achieving nothing. What to do about it is the
 * adapter's (exit non-zero, fail the invocation), and both are louder than
 * staying up.

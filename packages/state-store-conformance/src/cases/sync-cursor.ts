/**
 * A store remembers how far its caller has got, and it never claims more
 * progress than it holds.
 *
 * The cursor is one OPAQUE STRING under one key (`cursor.ts` at the seam), so
 * these cases never look at what it means: they check that what went in comes
 * out, that clearing forgets it, and -- the one that matters -- that the cursor
 * and the block it describes move as ONE unit.
 *
 * ## Why that last one is the case worth having
 *
 * Before the cursor lived here it was a second round trip after the block, and
 * the gap between them was not self-healing in either direction. A cursor left
 * BEHIND the state wedges the indexer: the restart replays a block the store
 * already holds and `applyBlock` refuses it, correctly, as the caller bug it
 * normally is, so no amount of restarting clears it
 * (`work/notes/observations/sync-cursor-write-is-not-atomic-with-the-block-it-describes.md`,
 * now deleted because it stopped being true). A cursor left AHEAD is worse and
 * quieter: the restart skips a block nothing ever applied, and the state is
 * simply missing it with nothing to say so.
 *
 * So the property asserted is symmetric. After a block applies, the cursor is
 * the one handed with it. After a block is REFUSED, the cursor is exactly what
 * it was before -- never a cursor describing a block this store does not hold.

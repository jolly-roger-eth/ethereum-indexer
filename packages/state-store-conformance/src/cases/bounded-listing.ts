/**
 * The one SET read at the seam, asked of every backend.
 *
 * A backend earns the right to be behind the seam by answering "which rows
 * belong to this parent" the same way as every other: ascending in the declared
 * id's own order, never more than the limit, and saying when the limit cut the
 * answer off. Those three are what a handler models a one-to-many on
 * (`@derivedFrom`-style: children keyed by their parent, the collection derived
 * WHEN READ), so a backend that gets any of them subtly wrong makes an idiomatic
 * model quietly incorrect rather than obviously broken.
 *
 * Nothing here looks at an access path: that a listing is an indexed range scan
 * rather than a scan-and-sort is a property of a particular backend, pinned in
 * that backend's own tests (`state-store-sqlite/test/listing.test.ts`).

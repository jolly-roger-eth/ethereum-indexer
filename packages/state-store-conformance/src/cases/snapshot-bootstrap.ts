/**
 * A store that started from state somebody else computed, and what it may then
 * claim about history it never received.
 *
 * ## Why this is a conformance case and not one backend's test
 *
 * The trap is inherited. A snapshot of CURRENT rows carries nothing below its
 * own block, so a store loaded from one cannot answer an as-of read below it --
 * and a freshly migrated store of any backend reports `unbounded`, because that
 * is true of a store that has been indexing since genesis and it has no way to
 * know it is not one. Every backend that ever exists behind this seam walks into
 * that the first time somebody bootstraps it, so the obligation belongs where a
 * new backend inherits it rather than where it would be rediscovered.
 *
 * The mechanism is at the seam (`openSnapshotAware`, one decorator over any
 * store), so what these cases really assert is that a backend supports the two
 * seam properties a bootstrap is built out of: rows and their cursor installing
 * as ONE unit (`applyBlock`'s third argument, for its other purpose), and a
 * cursor key that survives being written, read back by a fresh handle, and left
 * alone by a revert. A backend that breaks either one breaks bootstrapping,
 * and it fails here rather than in someone's browser tab.
 *
 * ## What is selected on the claim
 *
 * The same rule as every other case group: a store is tested against what it
 * SAYS. A backend that answers historical reads must refuse below the floor and
 * answer at and above it; a backend that answers none must go on refusing all of
 * them, because a floor is strictly weaker than "no history at all" and must not
 * be allowed to look like an upgrade.

/**
 * Every case a backend must pass, chosen against what that backend CLAIMS.
 *
 * The selection is the interesting part. A store is built once as a probe and
 * its `capabilities` are read -- before `migrate`, before any write, exactly as
 * a caller would read them at startup -- and the case list is assembled from
 * them: a store claiming `unbounded` gets asked a read at any depth, a store
 * claiming a WINDOW gets asked at both of its edges, and a store claiming no
 * historical read gets asked to refuse every one of them. Testing a backend
 * against a capability it never claimed would fail honest backends; testing it
 * against LESS than it claimed is what lets a claim become fiction.
 *
 * Everything else is asked of everyone: versioned reads, the reorg revert with
 * its counter that must go back DOWN, read-your-writes inside a block, the
 * bounded id-prefix listing a one-to-many is derived through, a block applying
 * as one unit, and what a prune must never delete (the same claim-driven
 * selection: what a store may drop is what it stopped promising to answer).

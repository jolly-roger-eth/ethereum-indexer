/**
 * ## What `process` returns when the state is a store rather than an object
 *
 * The `EventProcessor` contract is
 * `process(eventStream, lastSync) => ProcessResultType`, shaped for a processor
 * whose state is an in-memory object it can simply hand back. Materialising a
 * store into such an object would defeat the point: the store exists so that
 * "state at block N" is an index probe rather than something held in memory, and
 * it can hold more history than fits there.
 *
 * The core settles the question. `indexer.ts` never inspects the value: the
 * outcome of `process` and the `state` from `load` go to `_onStateUpdated`,
 * which forwards them to the optional `onStateUpdated` callback and nothing
 * else. So the return value is purely a channel to the consumer, and the
 * question is what the consumer most usefully receives. A read handle is O(1) to
 * produce, has stable identity across every call, and says exactly what it is.
 *
 * ## It is the SEAM TIER, and the omissions are the design
 *
 * There is no `queryCurrent` / `queryAsOf` here, and there is no stub throwing
 * "not supported on this backend" either. Those two take caller-supplied SQL and
 * exist only where a query planner does; a handle that is handed out whatever the
 * backend must not pretend otherwise. Leaving them OFF THE TYPE is what turns
 * "this deployment cannot answer that" into a compile error at the call site,
 * where the consumer can still choose a different backend, instead of a runtime
 * throw in a browser tab. `VersionedStateView` in `@etherfold/processor-sqlite`
 * is the tier that does have them, and it is reached by choosing SQLite on
 * purpose.
 *
 * The same split runs through the rest of the repo: `createReadSurface` (seam
 * tier, generated from declarations) against `createQuerySurface` (SQL tier), and
 * `MutationContext.list` (a bounded id-prefix listing) against a backend's own
 * richer reads. Two tiers, one schema source, ADR-0021's line.
 *
 * ## It is READ-ONLY on purpose
 *
 * Handing back the `StateStore` itself would put `applyBlock` and `revertTo` in
 * the hands of a UI callback, where a stray call corrupts the chain of versions
 * with no way to tell afterwards. The writer is the processor, and it is the
 * only writer.

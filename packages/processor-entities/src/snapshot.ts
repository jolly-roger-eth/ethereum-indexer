/**
 * ## Starting near the tip: the entity path's half of a capability the
 * free-form path already had
 *
 * `keepStateOnIndexedDB(name, remote)` in `@etherfold/browser` takes a URL or an
 * ARRAY of them, asks each mirror how far it has got, uses the one that has got
 * furthest, prefers the LOCAL state when local is already further along, and
 * fails over to the next mirror when one is unreachable rather than dying. That
 * is what lets a new tab of a shipped app come up in a second instead of
 * replaying every log the contract ever emitted.
 *
 * This module is the same behaviour for a store of versioned rows. What differs
 * is only the shape of what is downloaded (`StateSnapshot`, at the seam, whose
 * payload is the LIVE rows rather than one blob) and one thing that has no
 * free-form counterpart, because a blob has no history to lie about: a
 * bootstrapped store must report the floor its snapshot gives it, which
 * `openSnapshotAware` is responsible for and which this module simply must not
 * bypass.
 *
 * ## Why the mirror logic is HERE and not in `@etherfold/browser`
 *
 * Because it needs to read `lastToBlock` out of a stored cursor to answer "is
 * local already ahead", and the cursor's codec lives here (the seam persists an
 * opaque string on purpose, ADR-0027). `@etherfold/browser` deliberately does
 * not depend on any entity runtime -- it types the entity path structurally so
 * that it imports no processor package -- so putting this there would invert
 * that. Nothing here is browser-specific: `fetch` is a global in every runtime
 * this project targets, and a node consumer bootstraps with the same call.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * It is not the publishing side. A snapshot as a first-class published artifact
 * -- who produces one and when, mirror layout and discovery, retention of old
 * snapshots, and who is allowed to publish state a client accepts without
 * recomputing -- is a design of its own
 * (`work/notes/ideas/publishing-snapshots-of-versioned-state.md`).
 * `createSnapshot` below is the MINIMAL producer this module's tests need, and
 * it is deliberately the smallest thing that can make a valid envelope rather
 * than a shipping publisher.
 */

/**
 * Where a snapshot is published.
 *
 * A bare string is the snapshot itself. The object form adds an optional `head`:
 * the same envelope WITHOUT its rows, which is what a client fetches to decide
 * between mirrors before downloading any of them. That is the entity-path
 * counterpart of the free-form path's separate `lastSync` file, and it is
 * optional for the same reason it is there: a mirror that publishes only the
 * snapshot is still usable, it just costs a full download to compare.

 * differences, both deliberate:
 *
 * - **Failover walks every remaining candidate**, in descending order, where the

 *   says `// TODO more than 2`). With one mirror down and two up, this one gets
 *   state and that one does not.
 * - **A snapshot from another processor version is not a candidate at all.** The
 *   free-form keeper does not check, which is the gap
 *   `processor-version-hash-cannot-silently-lie` closed on the CLI's envelope.
 *   Here it is decisive rather than advisory, because a version mismatch means
 *   the rows describe different entities.
 *
 * Returning an OUTCOME rather than throwing on "nothing usable" is the same
 * judgement the free-form path makes: not finding a snapshot is a normal first
 * run in the wrong conditions, and the answer is to index from the start block.
 * What DOES throw is a snapshot that was selected and then turned out to be
 * unusable at install (`SnapshotProcessorMismatchError`, `SnapshotFormatError`),
 * because that is a publisher contradicting its own head.

/**
 * The `EventProcessor` that runs an `EntityProcessor` against ANY `StateStore`.
 *
 * This is the runtime the seam was built for and the one thing that was missing
 * from it. Everything underneath already named no backend --
 * `MutationContext`, the entity declarations, `runBlockHandlers`,
 * `applyEventStream` -- while the only shipped `EventProcessor` over the seam
 * built its own SQLite store from a `RemoteSQL` and kept its cursor in a SQL
 * table. So "one processor, several backends" was true in the test suite and
 * reachable through no deployment. Here the store is INJECTED, and everything
 * this class does to it is at the seam, so the same processor object indexes to
 * SQLite on a server, to IndexedDB in a browser tab, to the light patch store,
 * or to memory in a test, with nothing about the processor changed.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const store = await createBrowserStateStore(myProcessor.entities);   // browser
 * const store = new VersionedStateStore(db, myProcessor.entities);     // server
 * const processor = new EntityEventProcessor(store, myProcessor);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Revert is replay-free, and that is ADR-0001's revisit condition arriving
 *
 * The retired in-memory path (a free-form object plus a patch `History`) undid a reorg with
 * immer reverse-patches, because reverting by replay needs the state as of the
 * fork block and the in-browser path had no way to get it. ADR-0001 records that
 * choice and names the condition that would justify revisiting it: a store that
 * can answer "state as of block N". A versioned `StateStore` is that store, and
 * `revertTo(keepUpTo)` is neither replay nor an undo log, because the history IS
 * the storage model. A backend that keeps a patch log instead
 * (`@etherfold/state-store-patch`) implements the same verb its own way, which
 * is precisely what the seam is for.
 *
 * ## Where the cursor lives
 *
 * In the store, as an opaque string, written in the same transaction as the
 * block it describes. That is not filing: a cursor kept anywhere else is a
 * second round trip after the block, and a crash in that window leaves state
 * ahead of the cursor, which no restart clears. See `cursor.ts` here for what
 * the string means and `cursor.ts` at the seam for why the store owns it.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * Not a second implementation of anything. `VersionedStateEventProcessor` in
 * `@etherfold/processor-sqlite` is now a thin wrapper over this class that
 * builds the store from a `RemoteSQL` and hands back the SQL-tier read handle;
 * revert-then-apply exists once, here, which is the drift this whole seam exists
 * to prevent.

/**
 * Apply a whole stream to a store, reverting first if any of it is a retraction.
 *
 * This is the backend-agnostic half of processing, and every backend gets it
 * identically because it is written once, here, against `StateStore`. The stream
 * is a flat list in which reorged-out events carry `removed: true` and are
 * followed by the canonical replacements, if there are any. Three things about
 * how that becomes storage calls are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Revert ONCE, at the fork point**, not per removed event. The fork point
 *    is one below the LOWEST removed block in the stream, and it has to be
 *    computed over the whole stream before anything is applied. Reverting per
 *    event would issue N reverts where the second is a no-op at best and, if the
 *    events were ordered high-to-low, would revert to the wrong height.
 *
 * 2. **A removed event is a removed event, whatever caused it.** The engine
 *    emits retractions both when a height is replaced by a different hash (a
 *    contradiction) and when a block's logs simply vanish with no replacement
 *    (an absence: the transaction went back to the mempool). This reads `removed`
 *    and never looks at what replaced anything, so the second case cannot be
 *    missed. Wiring the revert to "a new hash appeared at this height" would
 *    reproduce `d24872f` one layer down, where the symptom is a row nobody
 *    notices instead of a state object somebody prints.
 *
 * 3. **Revert precedes apply**, which is also what makes replay safe. A store
 *    records a block plainly and a re-applied block raises on purpose.
 *    `revertTo(fork)` drops every block above the fork, and the canonical events
 *    in the same stream are all at or above `fork + 1`, so the replacements
 *    cannot collide with the branch they replace.
 *
 * One block is exactly one `applyBlock`, which is one atomic unit, which is why
 * a handler never has to reason about more than the block it is in.
 *
 * 4. **The cursor rides WITH the block**, when one is given. `cursor` is the
 *    `LastSync` this stream ends at, and each block is applied together with the
 *    cursor that describes THAT block (`syncedThrough`), in the store's own
 *    transaction. That is why the cursor lives behind the storage seam: nothing
 *    above the store can make the two atomic, and the gap between them is not
 *    self-healing in either direction (see `cursor.ts`). A caller that omits it
 *    -- a test, or the conformance workload -- gets the old behaviour and owns
 *    its own cursor.

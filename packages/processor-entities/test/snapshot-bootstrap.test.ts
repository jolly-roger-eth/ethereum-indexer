/**
 * A client that starts from state somebody else computed, instead of replaying
 * the chain from the start block.
 *
 * The free-form path has had this since it existed and the entity path would
 * otherwise have quietly lost it, so the cases below are written against the
 * behaviour that path actually ships: several published locations, the most
 * advanced one wins, an unreachable one is skipped rather than fatal, and local
 * state that is already further along is kept.
 *
 * The one thing with no free-form counterpart is the reason this is not a
 * mechanical port. A blob has no history to lie about; versioned rows do. A
 * snapshot of CURRENT rows carries nothing below its own block, so the store it
 * lands in must report that floor and refuse below it -- which is what
 * `openSnapshotAware` is for and what `openAndBootstrap` exists to keep on the
 * short path.

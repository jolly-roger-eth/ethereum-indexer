/**
 * ONE handler name can cover TWO wire events, and the type must say so.
 *
 * The same claim `@etherfold/js-processor`'s `test/handlerArgs.test.ts` makes,
 * asserted again HERE because this package holds its OWN copy of `InputValues`:
 * an author on either surface meets the same handler, so a fix to one copy is
 * not a fix for the other.
 *
 * An upgraded contract can emit `Transfer(address,address,uint256)` before the
 * upgrade block and `Transfer(address,address,uint256,bytes)` after it. They
 * share a NAME, so `ExtractAbiEventNames` collapses them and the author writes
 * ONE `onTransfer`. Mapped without distributing, the two input lists MERGED with
 * the v2-only field REQUIRED, and a pre-upgrade log handed the author
 * `undefined` through a type promising a value.
 *
 * **`pnpm typecheck` is what runs most of this file.** Each `@ts-expect-error`
 * FAILS the typecheck if the line it guards starts compiling, which is the only
 * way to assert that something is NOT accepted; vitest strips types with esbuild
 * without checking them. What vitest runs is the run-time half: that the
 * narrowing the types now force is the branch a v1 payload actually takes.

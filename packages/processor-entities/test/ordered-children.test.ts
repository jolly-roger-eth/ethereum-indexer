/**
 * The contortion this listing exists to remove, modelled the idiomatic way.
 *
 * `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md` (contortions 1 and 2) records
 * the real thing: `state.placements` is an ordered array that keeps seven
 * entries, evicting the oldest and dropping everything nested under it. Ported
 * to entities WITHOUT a listing it cost three entities plus a hand-maintained
 * CSV of positions (kept purely so the cascade delete had something to walk), a
 * `playerCount` per cell, and a singleton holding the arrival order; one `pop()`
 * became an O(cells x players) loop of manual deletes. That path ran 100 times
 * on the real stream.
 *
 * With a bounded id-prefix listing, the same model is what The Graph's
 * `@derivedFrom` would be: children are their own entity keyed by their parent,
 * the collection is DERIVED WHEN READ, and nothing is maintained at write time.
 * Two modelling rules from the spec do the rest:
 *
 * - **The window's children are keyed by ARRIVAL, not by a dense array index.**
 *   The ordinal is `(blockNumber, logIndex)`, which is naturally unique and
 *   naturally ordered, so appending needs no count and the eviction order is the
 *   key itself. Arrival order is not recoverable by sorting on `epoch` (epochs
 *   repeat and go backwards, as they do below), which is exactly why the port
 *   needed a singleton to remember it.
 * - **Keys that must sort numerically are fixed-width.** A listing is ascending
 *   in the id's own order, which is the order a range scan gives for free and is
 *   therefore LEXICOGRAPHIC over the stringified id: `'10'` sorts before `'9'`.
 *
 * Every backend runs it, because "expressible" has to mean expressible wherever
 * the processor is deployed -- including the patch store, where the same listing
 * is a sorted walk over a plain object rather than an indexed range scan, and
 * where the eviction below reads a collection this block has been writing to.

/**

 * identical state.
 *
 * Both backends here are real. The SQLite one is a real local libSQL database
 * behind `remote-sql`, never a mock, because the properties that matter (a
 * re-applied block raising, the DELETE-before-reopen ordering inside `revertTo`)
 * are properties of an engine. The other keeps versioned rows in a Map and owes
 * nothing to SQL, which is what makes the equality below worth asserting: if the
 * seam had leaked SQL semantics, this is where it would show.
 *
 * The processor object is imported, not written twice. Nothing in it names a
 * backend.

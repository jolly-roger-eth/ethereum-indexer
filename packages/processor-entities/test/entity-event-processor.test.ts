/**
 * The claim the storage seam was built to make, now reachable through a shipped
 * component: ONE processor definition, FOUR backends, the same state, and a
 * cursor that survives a restart on each of them.
 *
 * `two-backends.test.ts` next door already proves the ENGINE is neutral by
 * driving `applyEventStream` directly. What it cannot prove is that a
 * DEPLOYMENT is: until this class existed, the only `EventProcessor` over the
 * seam built its own SQLite store from a `RemoteSQL` and kept its cursor in a
 * SQL table, so "one processor, several backends" was true in a test suite and
 * reachable through nothing anyone could ship. So these cases go through the
 * `EventProcessor` contract the core actually drives -- `load`, `process`,
 * `reset` -- and never touch the store directly except to look.
 *
 * The processor object is IMPORTED, not written per backend. Nothing in it names
 * a backend, and that is the assertion underneath every case here.

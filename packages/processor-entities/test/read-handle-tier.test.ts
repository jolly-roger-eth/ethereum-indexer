/**
 * The backend-neutral read handle offers the SEAM TIER and nothing else, and
 * asking it for SQL is a COMPILE error rather than a runtime throw.
 *
 * `queryCurrent` / `queryAsOf` take caller-supplied SQL and exist only where a
 * query planner does. The alternative -- putting them on this handle as stubs
 * that throw "not supported on this backend" -- would move the discovery from
 * the developer's editor to a browser tab in production, which is precisely the
 * shape of failure the capability report exists to prevent, one layer up. So
 * they are simply not on the type, and a consumer that needs them chooses
 * `VersionedStateEventProcessor` and gets `VersionedStateView` instead.
 *
 * **`pnpm typecheck` is what runs the assertions in the first case.** Each
 * `@ts-expect-error` FAILS the typecheck if the expression it guards starts
 * compiling, so this file goes red the day someone adds a SQL method here --
 * which is the only way a test can assert that something does not exist.
 * Vitest, which strips types without checking them, is what proves the second
 * case: absent at run time too, rather than typed away and quietly present.

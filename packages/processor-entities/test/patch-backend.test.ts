/**
 * The claim, extended to the backend that stores no versions at all.
 *
 * `two-backends.test.ts` asserts that one processor produces identical state on
 * versioned SQL rows and on versioned rows in a Map. Those two are different
 * substrates for the SAME model, so the interesting question is whether the seam
 * leaked SQL. This file asks the harder one: the patch store keeps a plain
 * object and a log of immer reverse patches, has no version, no range and no
 * as-of read, and the processor still runs on it UNCHANGED, producing the same
 * state and reverting the same way.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `@etherfold/state-store-patch` because the
 * processor is here, and a store package must not depend on the indexer core
 * (ADR-0016). What that package's own tests keep is what only it can be asked:
 * the sparse stream, the pruned patch log, and the refusals.

# @etherfold/core

The engine. It fetches a contract's logs, decides what a reorg did to them, and drives an `EventProcessor` over the result. It stores nothing itself.

It names no host and no database: a browser tab, a Node process and a Worker all run this same code, and WHERE the derived state lives arrives from outside (the storage seam is [`@etherfold/state-store`](../state-store), reached through [`@etherfold/processor-entities`](../processor-entities)).

## When you want this package, and when you do not

Most applications never import it directly:

| you are | use |
| --- | --- |
| indexing in a browser tab | [`@etherfold/browser`](../browser), which wraps this in observable stores |
| indexing on a server, from a terminal | [`etherfold`](../cli), the CLI |
| writing the processor itself | [`@etherfold/processor-entities`](../processor-entities) |
| hosting the two halves of a split deployment yourself | here |

Take this package directly when you are building the host: a runtime this repo does not ship an adapter for, a test harness that drives the engine, or a deployment that splits fetching from folding.

## The two shapes it comes in

**One process, one source, one processor, one state: `IndexerGeneration`.** This is the client engine, and what [`@etherfold/browser`](../browser) is built on. It holds the sync cursor, the unconfirmed-block window and the optional cached stream, and it opens `load()` with `eth_chainId`, so it is the shape for a host that can talk to a chain. One stream plus one fold over it is a **generation**, which is what the name says; `Indexer` is the container that holds several of them and points at the one that answers reads.

```ts
import {IndexerGeneration} from '@etherfold/core';

const indexer = new IndexerGeneration(provider, eventProcessor, {
	chainId: '1',
	contracts: [{abi, address: '0x…', startBlock: 21000000}],
});

await indexer.load(); // adopt or discard whatever the processor already had
const lastSync = await indexer.indexMore(); // one batch; call it until `lastToBlock` reaches `latestBlock`
```

**Two halves, one wire: `LogFetcher` and `StreamBuilder`** (ADR-0003, ADR-0004). The fetcher is stateless and chain-facing; the stream-builder is chain-free, authoritative about where the next range must start, and derives every reorg. The transport between them is a dependency rather than a second implementation:

```ts
import {createDirectIngestion, createHttpIngestion, LogFetcher, StreamBuilder} from '@etherfold/core';

const builder = new StreamBuilder(eventProcessor, source, {stream: {}});

// combined: both halves in one process, no network in between
const fetcher = new LogFetcher(provider, source, createDirectIngestion(builder));

// split: the same fetcher, pushing to an indexer-server elsewhere
const remote = new LogFetcher(provider, source, createHttpIngestion({endpoint, token}));

await fetcher.fetchAndPush();
```

`fetchAndPush()` is ONE cycle and says nothing about when the next one runs; scheduling is [`@etherfold/fetcher-host`](../fetcher-host). What crosses is a `WireBatch` (`{context, fromBlock, toBlock, latestBlock, logs}`) and it always holds EVERY log in its range: truncation is expressed by LOWERING `toBlock`, never by sending part of one. A batch that does not start at the receiver's `expectedFromBlock` comes back as `UnexpectedFromBlockError` (`409` over HTTP), which is the one refusal a sender recovers from by re-sending; everything else is a `400` no block number fixes.

## What else is in here

- **The reorg model.** `removed: true` markers for retracted events, `unconfirmedBlocks` pruned past the finality window, and `ReorgCause` (`contradiction` = the same height now carries a different hash, `absence` = a block we held simply is not in the re-delivered range). The two are counted apart because a rising rate of the absence kind means truncation or misconfiguration rather than chain activity.
- **`checkTxInclusion`.** Whether the state you are about to render already accounts for a transaction, answered from the unconfirmed window and nothing else. An app laying an OPTIMISTIC update over indexed state needs it, because a non-idempotent update applied on top of state that already contains it is counted twice. The receipt cannot answer it: a reorg can re-include the same transaction in a different block.
- **The cached-stream seam.** `ExistingStream` plus `createSegmentedStream`, which turns a five-operation port into an append-only run of segments: one immutable segment per batch at the next ordinal, so a save costs its batch and not the history, and a write that would leave a HOLE is refused. [`@etherfold/browser`](../browser) supplies the IndexedDB port.
- **Stream fixtures.** `captureStream` records a real chain's logs; `replayStream` / `replayFixtureInto` play them back as an `ExistingStream`, which is how the conformance workload replays 31,332 real logs with no node in sight.
- **Source identity.** A configuration change is answered with TWO verdicts and never one: does the cached STREAM survive it, and does the derived STATE. A renamed non-indexed parameter is the case that proves they differ, since `topic0` hashes types and not names, so the fetch is untouched and the decode is not. Per-event live block ranges (`RangedAbiEvent`) are what let an upgrade APPEND an event without invalidating either. See `CONTEXT.md` for the full vocabulary.

## What is deliberately not here

Storage of the derived state, in any form. A processor persists through its `StateStore`, which writes the sync cursor in the same transaction as the block it describes (ADR-0027); this package has had no persistence seam of its own since the `KeepState` family went with the free-form processor path (ADR-0037).

Logging goes through [`named-logs`](https://github.com/wighawag/named-logs) (`logs('@etherfold/core')`), never `console.*`, so a host decides what is printed.

## Tests

`pnpm --filter @etherfold/core test`, vitest.

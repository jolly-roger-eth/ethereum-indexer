/**
 * The LOG-FETCHER of ADR-0003: the chain-facing half of a split deployment,
 * whose defining property is that it holds no state worth losing.
 *
 * One operation, `fetchAndPush()`: work out where to start, fetch a contiguous
 * range of logs, and push it. WHEN that runs is a host's business (a Node loop,
 * a Worker cron), which is why nothing here schedules anything.
 *
 * ## What it does not have, and why that is the design
 *
 * No cursor, no unconfirmed window, no reorg logic. The receiver owns all three
 * (ADR-0004), and that is what makes at-least-once on the wire exactly-once in
 * effect: the cursor IS the idempotency key, so a batch re-sent after a lost
 * acknowledgement is refused with a `409` and corrected instead of applied
 * twice. A fetcher that persisted its own cursor and trusted it would have
 * re-introduced the split brain the contract removes: two opinions of one value,
 * one of which is wrong exactly when it matters.
 *
 * What it DOES keep between cycles is a HINT (`cursorHint`): the last
 * `expectedFromBlock` the receiver reported. It is a cache, never an authority.
 * It saves one round-trip per cycle in the ordinary case; it is dropped the
 * moment a push fails, since a failed push may or may not have been applied; and
 * when it is wrong, the `409` that follows is not an error but the normal
 * correction path. Losing it costs one extra request and nothing else, which is
 * the test for whether a piece of state is safe to hold here.
 *
 * ## The one thing it must never get wrong
 *
 * **A payload holds EVERY log in `[fromBlock, toBlock]`.** Providers cap
 * `eth_getLogs`, and a short payload delivered as a complete range is read by
 * the receiver as an absence, an absence is a reorg, and a reorg deletes state.
 * So truncation is expressed by LOWERING `toBlock` (never by delivering part of
 * a range), a result set landing exactly on the cap is treated as suspect rather
 * than as an answer, and the envelope is checked with the receiver's own
 * `assertWellFormed` before it is sent.
 *
 * The half of that a DEPLOYMENT owns is `suspectResultCount`: a node that caps
 * silently is caught by matching its cap exactly, so a node capping at anything
 * other than the default 10000 must say so in configuration. See that option; it
 * is the sharpest edge on this class.
 *
 * ## Chain-bound, deliberately
 *
 * Every chain call in the deployment is here (`eth_chainId`, `eth_blockNumber`,
 * `eth_getLogs`, and the block/transaction reads a stream config asks for). The
 * receiver makes none, so the chain identity check is one only this side can
 * perform, and it is made both before fetching and before pushing.

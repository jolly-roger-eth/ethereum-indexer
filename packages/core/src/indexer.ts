// PROPOSAL FOR STATE ANCHORS
// we can have state anchor that get provided by the processor
// these set the minimum block to start fetching from

// What about prefetch
// proposal B1
// prefetch can fetch data and store it in logs.extra param
// prefecth need to keep track of its version
// we need to add more data to lastSync
// prefetchVersion
// if version change, we discard processor
//  - and we feed with prefetch to replace the extra field on each log + we resave that along with prefetch version in lastSync
// if no version changes, we are good
// whenever we process a log we perform a prefetch that add data to log.extra

// prefetch filter capabilities
// if prefetch can filter by for example returning a specific code
// then it would be great if we slim down the size of the stream by removing from it entirely
// the issue is that a new prefetch version would mean a need for indexing from scratch again
// Need to also care of reorg but this should be trivial : event removed whose event is not found is discarded

// conclusion:
// prefetch only filter capabilities should skip the event from being passed to the processor/
// but this is not very useful as the extra data could already allow the processor to skip the event picked
// so => no filter for pre-fetch
// but we could still have filter capabilties managed by another pass/process or has part of the indexer config
// and this one would slim down the event stream

	 * It caps `toBlock` at this generation's cursor and NOTHING ELSE. It truncates
	 * nothing, reverts nothing and never touches `revertTo`, so what this
	 * generation answers at the moment it pauses is what it goes on answering --
	 * which is what keeps a paused generation revertible-TO: moving the canonical
	 * pointer back to it restores its answers EXACTLY.
	 *
	 * ## Why it needs no new mechanism
	 *
	 * With `toBlock` capped at `x` and `lastToBlock = x`, the existing
	 * `getFromBlock` does the whole thing. While `latestBlock - finality <= x` it
	 * returns `latestBlock - finality`, so every round re-scans `[that, x]` -- a
	 * SHRINKING window that still corrects a reorg striking at or below the cap.
	 * Once `latestBlock - finality > x` it returns `x + 1`, which is above the
	 * capped `toBlock`, so the indexer takes its existing `fromBlock > toBlock`
	 * branch and fetches nothing. A paused generation self-terminates into a no-op
	 * poll; there is no timer, no branch and no state machine here to get wrong.
	 *
	 * `lastSync.latestBlock` deliberately keeps tracking the REAL head. Capping
	 * that too would make `getFromBlock` return `latestBlock - finality` forever
	 * and the drain would NEVER idle.
	 *
	 * ## What it is NOT
	 *
	 * It is NOT INSTANT: draining takes up to `finality` blocks of continued light
	 * polling, and a driver that stops calling `indexMore()` the moment it pauses
	 * leaves the generation holding an unconfirmed window forever. Watch
	 * `pauseState` for the moment it is `drained`.
	 *
	 * It is NOT `disableProcessing()`, which stops the engine where it stands --
	 * that IS the hazard: a generation carrying an unconfirmed window it can no
	 * longer correct never finds out that one of those blocks was reorged away, and
	 * its state permanently contains events from blocks that no longer exist.
	 *
	 * It is NOT persisted. A reload comes back running, and re-pausing costs one
	 * drain; making it durable is a registry record, which is the registry's to add
	 * when something needs it. It DOES survive a reconfigure in the session that
	 * asked for it -- `reinit` does not clear the cap -- because "do not go above
	 * x" is a decision about this generation and not about the source it was made
	 * under; `resume()` is the only thing that lifts it.
	 *
	 * It caps the verb that FETCHES (`indexMore`). A generation advanced with
	 * `followMore` goes exactly as far as the STREAM it folds and holds no
	 * `toBlock` of its own, so a cap would be a no-op that lied about being a
	 * pause: `Indexer.pause` refuses a follower for that reason

	 *
	 * ## Why a follower must not poll the head
	 *
	 * Three things break at once if it does, and the third is the one that matters.
	 * The re-fetch stops being zero and becomes merely fewer. The one-writer rule
	 * goes, because the save is driven by the indexing loop rather than by the
	 * caller's intent (which is why the read-only stream view exists at all). And
	 * -- the load-bearing one -- this generation's state becomes a function of ITS
	 * OWN FETCH rather than of the stream, so re-folding the stored stream later
	 * yields a DIFFERENT state. A generation would stop being "a stream plus a fold
	 * over it", and the promise that moving the canonical pointer back restores
	 * answers EXACTLY would go with it.
	 *
	 * ## What it is, mechanically
	 *
	 * The CATCH-UP branch of `promiseToLoad`, made repeatable. The first call has
	 * no cursor, so it loads -- which re-folds the whole stored stream from the
	 * start -- and every call after it reads the stream from where this cursor
	 * resumes and replays what is new. Nothing here fetches, and nothing here
	 * writes or CLEARS: a stream this generation does not own is not its to repair,
	 * which is why every branch below simply returns rather than clearing as the
	 * load path does.

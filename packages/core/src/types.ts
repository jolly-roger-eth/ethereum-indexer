 * An ABI event entry that also declares the BLOCK RANGE its event is live over.

 * instead of moving one whole-source hash: an entry that starts above the sync
 * cursor describes blocks nothing has indexed yet, so the state and the cached
 * event stream both survive it.
 *
 * It is also what lets a fetched block range ask only for the events that can
 * occur in it: below a `firstBlock`, or above a `lastBlock`, that event's
 * `topic0` is not in the request at all, and under argument filters that is a
 * whole `eth_getLogs` round trip the range no longer makes. It is never
 * consulted to DECODE a log, which is by `topic0` alone (ADR-0033).
 *
 * ## Both bounds are INCLUSIVE, and both directions of error are asymmetric
 *
 * For an upgrade at block `b`, the correct declaration is `A.lastBlock = b`
 * TOGETHER WITH `B.firstBlock = b` -- the SAME number on both -- because a
 * transaction earlier in block `b` still fires the old event while the upgrade
 * transaction later in that block starts the new one. That one-block overlap is
 * CORRECT and is deliberately not normalised away. An exclusive end would make
 * the correct declaration read `b + 1`, and the obvious thing to type would
 * silently drop every pre-upgrade log in block `b`.
 *
 * Which way to err, because the indexer cannot check either number for you:
 *
 * - **`firstBlock` too EARLY is safe**; too LATE loses logs undetectably. The
 *   blocks between the real first occurrence and the declared one are indexed
 *   without that event in the filter, so afterwards nothing distinguishes "the
 *   chain had none" from "we never asked". For a proxy deployment the
 *   implementation's own deploy block is naturally safe: an implementation
 *   cannot emit before it exists.
 * - **`lastBlock` too LATE is safe**; too EARLY loses logs the same way, and for
 *   the same reason. Omit it unless you know the event stopped.
 *
 * A `lastBlock` is an ASSERTION the indexer can act on and can never verify.
 * The only thing it does verify is coverage: a GAP between two ranges of one
 * event is refused at construction, because a hole is a span nobody requests.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE GENERATION CONTAINER: the indexer that HOLDS generations, one of which is
 * canonical and answers every read.
 *
 * `IndexerGeneration` is one stream plus one processor
 * plus one state, which under this model is a GENERATION and not the container.
 * This is the container, and the name follows `CONTEXT.md`, which has defined
 * *indexer* as the named unit holding generations, carrying the caps and holding
 * ONE canonical pointer since ADR-0036.
 *
 * ## What it adds, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * It adds four things:
 *
 * 1. **Generations are BUILT from factories, not handed over already built.** A
 *    container that holds N generations cannot be given one already-constructed
 *    processor over one already-constructed store, because each generation folds
 *    into its OWN state. So a generation arrives as a `GenerationSpec`: a state
 *    factory and a processor factory, called once each, in that order.
 * 2. **Reads resolve through the CANONICAL POINTER, indirectly.** `state` is a
 *    handle that answers from whichever generation is canonical NOW, so holding
 *    a reference across a promotion is never a way to read a retired generation
 *    (story 6).
 * 3. **A pointer move is APPLIED AT A NOTIFICATION.** See `promote` for why that
 *    single rule is the whole read unit of work, and why no scope API, no
 *    transaction handle and no timer is needed to get it.
 * 4. **EVERY generation it holds ADVANCES, and HOW each one advances is
 *    DETERMINED rather than configured.** A generation that shares its stream
 *    with one already held is a FOLLOWER: it fetches nothing, writes nothing,
 *    re-folds the stored stream from the start and then follows it. A generation
 *    on its own stream is an ordinary indexer at a different address. There is no
 *    knob, and `add` is where the rule lives.
 *
 * It also PUBLISHES a discard (`publishDiscard`), which is not a fifth thing but
 * the second one applied to the case `onStateUpdated` never covered: a fold that
 * was thrown away is neither adopted nor produced, so without this a subscriber
 * holding the state it lost is told by nothing.
 *
 * 5. **A generation PAUSES by capping and draining**, and the container is where
 *    one is named: `pause` / `resume` take the generation, because pausing is a
 *    fact about one generation and not about the indexer. It adds no mechanism of
 *    its own -- the cap lives on the engine and the drain is the existing
 *    `getFromBlock` -- and `HeldGeneration.pauseState` is what a consumer watches
 *    for the DRAINING period to end.
 * 6. **It APPLIES the promotion policy**, which is WHEN the pointer moves on its
 *    own and what happens to the generation left behind. The three values and
 *    their one default live in `generation/promotion.ts`; what lives here is the
 *    application of them -- see `applyPolicyTo` (at creation), `settlePromotion`
 *    (the trigger, once per advance) and `dropSuperseded`.
 *
 * It still does not turn a RECONFIGURE VERB into a new generation:
 * `updateIndexer` and `updateProcessor` do to the canonical generation exactly
 * what they did before. Building a successor is `add`, which is what a caller
 * that wants a reconfigure without an outage calls.

 * FOLD half is only known once the processor exists, and the processor needs its
 * state -- so the state cannot be keyed on the finished identity, and a design
 * that tried would deadlock on the first reload (find the record to learn the
 * store to build the processor to compute the record's key).
 *
 * The way out is that the factories are supplied PER GENERATION rather than once
 * for the container: the caller's own closure is what distinguishes this

	 *
	 * It does not become canonical (unless nothing is, which is the registry's
	 * rule for the first one), and it DOES advance -- but how it advances is
	 * decided here and is not a choice anybody gets to make.
	 *
	 * ## The rule: a SHARED stream makes a FOLLOWER, and nothing else does
	 *
	 * A generation whose stream digest matches one already held is handed a
	 * READ-ONLY VIEW of the keeper (`readOnlyStream`) and advances with
	 * `followMore`: it fetches NOTHING, writes NOTHING, re-folds the stored stream
	 * from the start and then follows it as the indexing generation appends. A
	 * generation on a stream nobody here holds keeps the keeper itself and advances
	 * with `indexMore`, which is an ordinary indexer at a different address.
	 *
	 * There is no flag, because a flag would be wrong in both positions. "Follow a
	 * stream nobody writes" never advances; "fetch a stream somebody else writes"
	 * is a second writer, and it also makes this generation's state a function of
	 * its own fetch rather than of the stream, which is what would break the exact
	 * revert (`IndexerGeneration.followMore`). ADR-0044 records the rule and the
	 * options weighed against it.
	 *
	 * ## Which generation WRITES a stream: the first one held on it
	 *
	 * Registration order and not the canonical pointer, so the writer is stable:
	 * moving the pointer is one small record write and must not silently hand the
	 * append duty to a different engine mid-flight. The normal case makes the two
	 * the same thing anyway, since the first generation registered is the one the
	 * registry makes canonical.
	 *
	 * The registry is written BEFORE the engine exists, which is the order its own
	 * documentation asks for: a stream subtree no registered generation claims is
	 * what the sweep collects, so nothing may write a stream ahead of its
	 * registration.

	 * this for its own `state` store until `the-old-indexer-shape-is-deleted`; it is
	 * here because the container is what knows a verb discarded, and because every
	 * other consumer of one (a server, a CLI, a test) was never told at all.
	 *
	 * **A DISCARD DOES NOT ALWAYS LEAVE NOTHING**, which is the whole reason for the

	 * and publishes the rebuilt state before the verb returns. That publication is
	 * the truth; dropping the handle and re-announcing an empty fold on top of it
	 * would report a correct rebuild to every subscriber as an empty state, with the

/**
 * WHAT A GENERATION IS, as ONE value: its stream, plus the fold over it.
 *
 * `GenerationId` is the identity and this is the RENDERING of it, for the one
 * job an identity has when it leaves the process: being REPORTED to somebody who
 * compares it against the last one they saw. The registry keeps the two halves
 * apart because it KEYS on them (a composite key compared element by element
 * cannot confuse one component's rendering with another's); a report is not a
 * key, and a reader that is handed two named fields will read one of them.
 *
 * ## It is OPAQUE, and that is the whole point
 *
 * The same call `feed/cursor.ts` makes for the cursor, and for the same reason:
 * what a client can read, a client comes to depend on. A consumer told
 * `{stream, processor}` will one day branch on the processor half, and then
 * WHAT a generation is composed of can never change -- while this project fully
 * expects it to (the stream digest itself replaced `{source, config}`, and a
 * generation carrying more than a version hash is a plausible future). A digest
 * has nothing to reach into, so the composition stays ours.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a hiding measure. There is no key here and the rule is
 * written above: anyone determined can recompute one from a stream digest and a
 * version hash. What it stops is ACCIDENTAL dependence, which is the failure
 * that actually happens.

 * one generation -- so a consumer that re-subscribed after a stream mismatch
 * would be told nothing had changed at the exact moment everything had. The
 * stream alone would miss the case this value exists for: SAME logs, DIFFERENT
 * fold, which no cursor check can see.
 *
 * Rendered like a stream digest (`sha256`, truncated to 128 bits, fixed-length
 * lowercase hex, no `0x`) because it is the same kind of thing and there is no
 * reason for two renderings; and 128 bits because a collision here is a change a

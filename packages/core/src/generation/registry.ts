/**
 * THE GENERATION REGISTRY: which generations an indexer holds, which one is
 * CANONICAL, what a cap refuses, and what is swept because nothing claims it.
 *
 * A **generation** is a stream plus a fold over it. An indexer holds any number
 * of them; ONE is canonical and answers every read. Reconfiguring builds a new
 * generation beside the live one and moves the pointer when it is ready, which
 * is why a reconfigure is not an outage -- and moving the pointer BACK is how a
 * processor change that made the state worse is reverted, with no re-index and
 * no fetch.
 *
 * This module is BOOKKEEPING and nothing else. It never fetches, never folds,
 * never opens a state store, and holds no reference to a chain: everything here
 * is exercisable with no indexer running, which is the point. The rules live
 * here once, over a port, exactly as `createSegmentedStream` does, so a second
 * substrate (SQL for a server, another keeper in a browser) supplies five
 * operations and inherits all of them.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here:
 *
 * - **The promotion POLICY.** WHEN the pointer moves automatically -- on
 *   catch-up, immediately, or never -- needs a running indexer and is
 *   `the-promotion-policy-moves-the-canonical-pointer`. This owns the pointer as
 *   a MECHANISM: move it, read it, move it back.
 * - **Eviction.** A cap REFUSES and names what to delete. See
 *   `GenerationCapReachedError`.
 * - **Where a generation's state store lives.** Dropping one is a port
 *   operation the host supplies, because the container above `StateStore` that
 *   decides that is a later task.
 */

/**
 * WHICH generation: the stream it folds, and the processor that folds it.

 * The two halves are the whole identity. The stream digest (`streamDigestOf`)
 * already covers the fetch filter AND the stream config, so naming the config
 * again here would be redundant; the processor's `version` hash covers what the
 * fold MEANS. A processor change is therefore a new generation over the SAME
 * stream and re-fetches nothing, and a filter or config change is a new stream.
 *
 * Kept as two FIELDS and never packed into one delimited string: a composite key

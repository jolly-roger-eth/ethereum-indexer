 * while the list lives in another one gets the new refusal RETRIED, silently and
 * forever, which is the exact failure ADR-0004's two refusal codes exist to make
 * impossible.
 *
 * Read STRUCTURALLY (`err.retryable === false`) rather than with `instanceof`,
 * so that an error crossing a package boundary from a second copy of this module
 * still classifies correctly.
 *
 * An error that does NOT carry it is treated as retryable, deliberately: those
 * are the ones this package did not throw -- a node's JSON-RPC error, a dropped
 * socket, a `fetch` rejection -- and transience is the honest default for them.
 * Everything thrown from HERE says so explicitly.

/**
 * A batch that did not start where the receiver said it must.
 *
 * ## Why this is a TYPE and not a message
 *
 * ADR-0004 makes the receiver authoritative about the cursor, and the whole
 * resumption protocol is this one refusal: the sender is told the block it must
 * re-send from, and it re-sends from there. A caller that has to read
 * `expectedFromBlock` out of an English sentence is a caller that breaks the
 * next time the sentence is reworded, and an HTTP layer on top has to put that
 * number in a response body. So the number is carried, not narrated.
 *
 * It is thrown by `generateStreamToAppend` itself rather than by a check placed
 * in front of it. That matters: a second check would be a second, parallel
 * mechanism that can disagree with the engine, which is exactly what ADR-0004
 * chose this design to avoid. There is one rule, in one function, and this is
 * the shape it refuses in.
 *
 * ## And why it is not an idempotency failure
 *
 * A re-sent batch after a lost acknowledgement lands here, because the cursor
 * has already moved past its `fromBlock`. That is not an error to paper over:
 * it IS the deduplication. At-least-once on the wire becomes exactly-once in
 * effect, with no dedupe table and no explicit key, because the cursor is the
 * key.

 *   `toBlock`, never by delivering a different set. A `complete: true` field
 *   would always be true and would therefore carry no information;

 * matters more here than anywhere else in the system, because a short payload
 * delivered as a complete range is read by the receiver as an ABSENCE, and an
 * absence is a reorg, and a reorg DELETES state (ADR-0004; the same inference
 * produced the bug fixed in `d24872f`).
 *
 * So a fetch landing exactly on the cap is treated as suspect and the range is
 * halved until the answer comes back under it. This is thrown only when there is
 * nothing left to halve: a SINGLE block that still returns exactly the cap. At
 * that point there is no honest answer available, and refusing to push is the
 * only safe move -- delivering could destroy state, and lowering `toBlock`
 * further is not possible.
 *
 * The operator's fix is to raise the fetcher's `maxEventsPerFetch` above the

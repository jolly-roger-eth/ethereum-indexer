 * in the cursor record beside the segments.
 *

 * entity path's serialized sync cursor, and a stream keeper's copy is read by
 * nobody -- `promiseToFeed` takes
 * only the three block numbers and `generateStreamToAppend` rebuilds the window

 * only watches the writes. It is read INSIDE the commit, which is what makes the
 * allocation safe when two tabs save at once.
 *
 * `startBlock` is the `lastFromBlock` of the FIRST save into this subtree,
 * written once and never updated. It is what lets `fetchFrom` refuse a stream it

 * two load branches, so a self-clear on the other one leaves a NEW subtree whose

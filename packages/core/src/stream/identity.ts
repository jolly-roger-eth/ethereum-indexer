 * `<streamDigest>` level of the stream address (ADR-0035). A stream is RESOLVED
 * by what it contains, so two generations with different filters never collide
 * and one with the same filter is reused.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a fact about who indexed it: the `<indexer-name>` level of
 * the address is the tenancy discriminator and it already exists, so nothing
 * about an indexer, a processor or a caller belongs in here.

/**
 * The digest that IDENTIFIES a stream, over the DEDUPLICATED `streamHash`
 * values SORTED BY THEMSELVES, plus the resolved stream config.
 *
 * ## Why sorted by THEMSELVES, and not taken in the entry list's order
 *
 * `sourceHashesOf` returns its entries sorted by `(startBlock, hash)`, and
 * `hash` covers the DECODING shape. So renaming a non-indexed parameter -- the
 * exact case the two-digest split exists for -- REORDERS that list while every
 * `streamHash` in it is unchanged. A digest rolled up over the list in that
 * order would move, fork a new stream, re-fetch the whole history and orphan the
 * old one, silently and with no error. Taking the `streamHash` values alone,
 * deduplicating them and sorting them by themselves is what makes the digest a
 * function of the SET of filter facts. `hash` and `legacyHash` are excluded for
 * the same reason: they are the fold's identity, not the stream's.
 *
 * Note what the set already contains: the block-0 SKELETON entry, whose
 * `streamHash` covers `chainId`, `genesisHash`, and each contract's address and
 * `startBlock`. That is why `chainId` is not an address level of its own -- it
 * is in here.
 *
 * ## Why the CONFIG is in it
 *
 * The filter is not the only thing that decides what a stream CONTAINS.
 * `alwaysFetchTimestamps`, `alwaysFetchTransactions` and `parse.filters` each
 * change WHAT IS STORED, and `sourceInvalidationOf` already invalidates the
 * STREAM half from block 0 whenever the config hash moves. Keyed on the filter
 * alone, two different configs would map to ONE stream and a generation would
 * adopt logs the verdict has already declared invalid -- with the only existing
 * remedy (clear the stream) destroying the stream the live generation is still
 * answering from.
 *
 * It takes the RESOLVED config (`resolveStreamConfig`), so an unset `finality`
 * and the default written out are one stream, exactly as they are one config
 * everywhere else. The config's canonical BYTES go in rather than its
 * `simple_hash`: that digest is 32 bits, and here a collision is not a missed
 * invalidation but two configs sharing one stream.
 *
 * ## Why this hash
 *
 * `viem`'s `sha256`, truncated to 128 bits. It is already a direct dependency
 * and it is SYNCHRONOUS, which `crypto.subtle` is not (it also needs a secure
 * context). ONE implementation, never a native fast path beside a pure-JS
 * fallback: two implementations that must agree byte for byte would give
 * different stream ADDRESSES on different browsers, which is the silent
 * history-orphaning this digest exists to prevent. 128 bits because this is a
 * KEY and not a change DETECTOR: `simple_hash`'s 32 bits are a coin-flip
 * collision around 65,000 distinct filters, and a collision here means one
 * generation silently adopting another's stream under a filter that does not
 * match it, so logs are missing and nothing reports it.
 *
 * Rendered as FIXED-LENGTH lowercase hex, with no `0x`: every substrate has to
 * carry it as a KEY ELEMENT (a string on IndexedDB, a column on SQL), and a
 * fixed length is what stops one digest's rendering being read as another's.

/**
 * A STREAM YOU CAN ONLY READ: an `ExistingStream` whose `saveNewEvents` and
 * `clear` are no-ops.
 *
 * ## Why this has to exist at all
 *
 * READ and WRITE share ONE seam. A generation handed the stream to fold is
 * handed the thing that also appends, and `promiseToSave` calls `saveNewEvents`
 * UNCONDITIONALLY -- so "a generation that merely reads" is not something a
 * caller can express by declining to write, and it is not something a
 * CONFIGURATION could express either, because the save is driven by the indexing
 * loop rather than by the caller's intent. It is expressed by handing over a
 * stream whose writes go nowhere.
 *
 * That is what makes the ONE-WRITER RULE structural: only the generation that
 * INDEXES a stream is given the keeper, every other generation folding it is
 * given one of these, and a second writer is therefore unreachable rather than
 * merely discouraged.
 *
 * ## Why the writes are NO-OPS and not refusals
 *
 * A throw would wedge the engine, and correctly so: it does not process a batch
 * it could not write (`StreamWriteOutcome`), so a refusing keeper would freeze
 * the fold rather than leave it read-only. Silence is the honest answer here --
 * there is nothing to write, because somebody else already wrote it.
 *
 * `clear` is a no-op for a sharper reason than symmetry: the load path clears
 * the cached stream on every shape it cannot use (a stream that does not match
 * the source, a stream that will not re-parse, a stream that does not reach back
 * far enough), and a follower takes those branches over a stream ANOTHER
 * generation is still indexing into. A view that passed `clear` through would
 * delete the live generation's history from underneath it.
 *
 * ## One view, two callers
 *
 * `replayStream` (a captured fixture) was already exactly this shape and is now
 * built out of it, so there is ONE definition of what read-only means on this
 * seam rather than two that can drift apart.
 *
 * The rule this serves, and the options weighed against it, are ADR-0044.

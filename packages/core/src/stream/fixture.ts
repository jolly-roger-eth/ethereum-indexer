/**
 * The on-disk format version of a captured stream.
 *
 * A fixture is a SNAPSHOT, so it is read long after it was written, by code that
 * has moved on. The version is what lets a reader refuse a shape it does not
 * understand instead of half-parsing it.
 *
 * ## Why it is 2
 *
 * Format 1 wrote BigInts as `"123n"`, which is also a legal string for a
 * contract to emit, so a reader could not tell a `uint256` argument from a
 * string argument that read like one. Format 2 tags them (`utils/bigint.ts`).
 * The bump is what makes that change SAFE: a format-1 file parsed by this reader
 * would come back with every BigInt silently turned into a string, and it is
 * refused below instead. The two fixtures committed in this repo were
 * re-encoded; see `docs/spikes/tagged-bigint-codec-across-storage-adapters/`.

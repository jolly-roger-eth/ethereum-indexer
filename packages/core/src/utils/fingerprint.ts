/**
 * ## What a code fingerprint is, and what it is deliberately NOT
 *
 * `getVersionHash()` is the identity of a processor's LOGIC, and the core
 * discards persisted state when it changes. That identity is author-declared:
 * an author who edits a handler and forgets to bump `version` gets state
 * computed by the previous logic, served forever, silently. The fingerprint is
 * the second opinion, derived from the handler implementations themselves, so
 * that "declared version unchanged but the code underneath it changed" becomes
 * something the core can SAY rather than something nobody can see.
 *
 * It is **advisory** and stays out of `getVersionHash()`. Folding it in would be
 * safer in principle and unusable in practice: a bundler or minifier that
 * re-emits the same behaviour differently would invalidate every deployment's
 * state and force a full replay with no logic change. Advisory makes that false
 * positive a log line instead of a multi-hour rebuild. (This deviates from
 * `docs/adr/0008`, which asks for the folding-in; see the task record.)
 *
 * ## What it survives, and what it does not
 *
 * The source is `Function.prototype.toString()`, normalised by collapsing every
 * run of whitespace to a single space. Measured against this repo's own
 * toolchain (tsc 6.0.3, esbuild 0.28 as vitest uses it):
 *
 * - **Survives**: process restarts (the string is a pure function of the loaded
 *   source), re-indentation and reformatting, and re-ordering the handlers on
 *   the object (the payload is keyed and sorted by property name).
 * - **Does NOT survive**: minification (identifiers are renamed), a change of
 *   transpiler or target (tsc keeps comments and indents with four spaces,
 *   esbuild strips comments and indents with two), or editing a COMMENT inside a
 *   handler under a toolchain that keeps comments. Each of those reports drift
 *   with no logic change.
 *
 * ## Why it is tagged `fp-`
 *
 * So that a value found in a stored cursor says what it is. The structural
 * protection it used to provide (a fingerprint must never read as a `"123n"`
 * BigInt to the storage adapters that revive them) now lives one level down, in
 * `simple_hash`, which prefixes every digest for that reason and so protects
 * `context.processor` and `context.config` too. See `utils/bigint.ts` for the
 * bug that motivated both.
 *
 * ## Comments
 *
 * Comments are left in rather than stripped, and that is a choice about which
 * way to be wrong. Stripping them from arbitrary source text needs a JS lexer
 * that gets regex-vs-division right; a lexer that gets it wrong deletes real
 * code from the payload, and a change inside the deleted region then reads as NO
 * drift. Over-reporting is recoverable by bumping the version; under-reporting
 * is the exact failure this exists to prevent.

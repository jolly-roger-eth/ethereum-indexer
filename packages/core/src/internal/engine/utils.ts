 *
 * The grouping is over CONSECUTIVE RUNS and not over the whole list, which
 * matters as soon as the stream being grouped is a whole STORED stream rather
 * than one generated batch. A stream that spans many cycles can apply a block,
 * retract it and apply it again under the same hash (the chain went A, then B,
 * then back to A), and keying a map by `{removed, hash}` alone would fold that

 * Turn a STORED emission stream back into the stream to deliver, honouring the

 *
 * This is the IN direction of the same seam `groupStreamPerBlock` is the OUT
 * direction of, and it exists because a REPLAY is not a FETCH.
 * `generateStreamToAppend` takes raw logs from a stateless `eth_getLogs` -- a
 * complete re-read of a range, carrying no verdicts -- and DERIVES every
 * retraction by comparing the cursor's unconfirmed window against the incoming
 * blocks by number. A stored stream is the opposite kind of input: it is a
 * DELTA that already records what was applied and what was taken back, at the
 * original block, flagged `removed`.
 *
 * Routing one through the other is the defect this closes. A rebuild starts from
 * a fresh cursor whose window is EMPTY, so there was nothing to derive a
 * retraction from, and `groupLogsPerBlock` drops the `removed` events out of
 * what it is handed (rightly: in a fetch such a marker has no business
 * existing). A stream containing a reorg therefore replayed as both branches
 * applied as live blocks, with no revert anywhere.
 *
 * ## The WINDOW is rebuilt by walking the stream, not by filtering it
 *
 * The cursor a replay leaves behind must be the one the live run held, window
 * included, or the first tip cycle after it re-reads the finality window, finds
 * the replacement block missing from the window, and applies it a SECOND time.
 * So the walk maintains the window as it goes: an applied block enters it, a
 * retracted block LEAVES it. Filtering the stream for its non-`removed` entries
 * instead would leave both branches of a reorg at one height -- a window no live
 * run ever held.
 *
 * The walk deliberately does NOT prune by finality as it goes, only at the end:
 * the stored stream records no per-batch chain tip, and keeping every live block
 * in hand until the end is what guarantees a retraction always finds the block
 * it retracts. The final prune uses `newLastToBlock`, which is the carry-forward
 * rule `generateStreamToAppend` applies to a block it is keeping.
 *
 * ## Why the window is also what DE-DUPLICATES
 *
 * A replay has two shapes. A REBUILD hands over the whole stream against an
 * empty window. A CATCH-UP hands over the part of it above a kept state's resume
 * point, which reaches back over the finality window and therefore re-offers
 * blocks that state already applied -- and those are exactly the blocks in its
 * window. So an applied block whose hash is already there is SKIPPED rather than
 * delivered twice. That is the same job the fetch path's window-membership test
 * does (`generateStreamToAppend`), and the two are decided the same way for the
 * same reason: a held block is named by its hash, never by a height, because a
 * height names whichever branch won.

 * one: the function used to admit a block only at or above
 * `startingBlockForNewEvent` (`reorgBlock.number` on a reorg, the window's top
 * plus one otherwise). That threshold encodes the claim "we already hold
 * everything below this height", and the claim is FALSE, because
 * `unconfirmedBlocks` holds only EVENT-BEARING blocks and is therefore SPARSE:
 * its lowest entry is usually far above the height the chain actually forked at.
 * So when the fork was below the lowest block we held logs for, every log the
 * replacement branch carried in that gap was inside the re-fetched range,
 * dropped by the comparison, and never fetched again -- the next range starts
 * above it. Silent, permanent loss (`docs/adr/0051`).
 *
 * Membership is SOUND because of an invariant `getFromBlock` maintains: a
 * re-fetch never starts below `latestBlock - finality`, and a block that carried
 * events inside that window entered `unconfirmedBlocks` when it was applied. So
 * every incoming block we have already applied is still in the window -- unless
 * it was RETRACTED, which is why the test reads the window that SURVIVED the
 * retraction rather than the one we arrived with. "The window holds it" is
 * therefore a complete test for "we already applied it", and nothing is
 * delivered twice.

 * It is also the rule the REPLAY path in this file already applies, by hash, for
 * the same de-duplication reason. The two were meant to agree; only one of them

 *   leaves a strict SUPERSET, which is reusable: decode less.
 * - `state` is about the fold over DECODED events. It dies whenever the decoding
 *   shape moved, even if not one log needs re-fetching.
 *
 * A renamed non-indexed parameter is the case that proves they are two
 * questions: `topic0` hashes types and not names, so the fetch is untouched and
 * the decode is not.
 *
 * The implication runs ONE WAY, by construction rather than by rule: an invalid
 * stream is always an invalid state too, because everything `streamHash` commits
 * to (the address, the `topic0`, the range) is also committed to by `hash`, so
 * nothing can move the filter without moving the decode. The converse is exactly

/**
 * Whether a persisted `lastSync` describes the source and stream config we are

 *
 * It answers about the first two identities only; `context.processor` is
 * compared separately by the caller, because the two mismatches mean different
 * things (a processor upgrade is expected and routine, a source change is not).
 *
 * A differing stream config invalidates EVERYTHING, from block 0, on both
 * halves: it is hashed into the wire identity and describes how logs were
 * fetched as much as what they meant.
 *
 * ## Reading a context written before this split
 *
 * `ContextIdentifier` is PERSISTED, so a stored context has to be readable
 * whatever version wrote it. There are three shapes, and a context that does not
 * describe a changed source must never read as invalid -- that would silently
 * re-index every existing deployment on upgrade, which is the exact cost
 * per-event hashing removes.
 *
 * - **per-event** (what this code writes): both halves are decided
 *   independently.
 * - **per-range, no `streamHash`** (what the ranged path wrote): the `hash` of
 *   every entry is computed exactly as it was, so the set diff on `hash` matches
 *   byte for byte and the state verdict is unchanged. The stored entries say
 *   nothing about the FILTER they were fetched under, so the stream half falls
 *   back to the state verdict rather than guessing.
 * - **one whole-source entry** (what an un-ranged source wrote): a digest over
 *   bytes no per-event entry reproduces, so it is compared against the one thing
 *   that does reproduce them, `legacyHash` on the block-0 entry. Equal means the
 *   source did not move and NOTHING is invalidated; unequal means it did, and
 *   the old entry cannot say where, so both halves go from block 0 exactly as
 *   they did before. Either way the next save writes the per-event list, so a
 *   deployment pays this at most once.

 *
 * ## Why it is a function and not two well-behaved call sites
 *
 * It was two call sites, and they DIVERGED. `reinit` hashed the config it had
 * resolved; `updateIndexer` hashed the config as the caller PASSED it. Since the
 * stored hash always carried `finality` and a caller usually leaves it unset --
 * which is what the resolver exists for -- the two could never match, so
 * `sourceInvalidationOf` reported `reason: 'stream-config'` on a reconfigure
 * that moved nothing, and that verdict invalidates the STREAM half from block 0:
 * the cache is cleared and the whole history is re-fetched from the node.
 *
 * A comment cannot hold that shut, and the resolve is the easy half to forget
 * precisely because forgetting it still compiles and still produces a digest.
 * So the step is ONE function every caller goes through, and
 * `test/updateIndexer.test.ts` asserts that no second site in the package hashes

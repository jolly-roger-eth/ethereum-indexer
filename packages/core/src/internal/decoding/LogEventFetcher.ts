/**

 *
 * Keyed on the canonical SIGNATURE -- so on `topic0`, which is its hash --
 * because that is what a log carries. Keying on the NAME made two versions of
 * one event across an upgrade, and two contracts declaring same-named events,
 * look like a clash they are not: `Transfer(address,address,uint256)` and
 * `Transfer(address,address,uint256,bytes)` have different topic0s and are
 * trivially told apart on the wire, so both are kept and both are requested.
 *
 * A shared topic0 with a different DEFINITION is the genuine ambiguity, and it
 * is refused here, at construction, naming both declarations. No block boundary
 * resolves it either: an upgrade transaction sits mid-block, so both meanings
 * share a block.
 *
 * What this must never do again is DROP one silently. A spliced event's topic0
 * never entered the fetch filter, so its logs were never asked for, and
 * afterwards nothing distinguished "the chain had none" from "we never asked"
 * -- an absence inferred from a request that was never made, the same failure
 * class as `absence` vs `contradiction` in the reorg model.

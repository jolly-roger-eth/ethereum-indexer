 * through `ReorgRecorder`, and a read tier that owns no store at all reads them
 * back off the database. Two packages have to name one key, and this is the only
 * package both of them already depend on -- and the one that decides what a

/**
 * The INVALIDATION VERDICT, published because a caller outside this package has
 * to act on it.
 *
 * `sourceInvalidationOf` answers, for a reconfigure, whether the stored data
 * still describes the source being run now -- separately for the raw log STREAM
 * and for the STATE folded out of it -- and names the block each half stopped
 * being valid FROM. That answer used to reach a log line and nothing else, so
 * every consumer got the one bit `ReconfigureOutcome.stateDiscarded` collapses
 * it into, and one bit cannot say which half died or from where.
 *
 * The TYPES are exported and the FUNCTION deliberately is not. The verdict is
 * REPORTED, on `ReconfigureOutcome`, for the same reason the discard is: a
 * caller re-deriving the rule from its own hashes gets a second, divergent
 * answer, and it fails in exactly the silent direction the report exists to
 * close.
 *
 * Do not confuse this with `streamDigestOf`. The verdict decides WHETHER
 * anything is invalid; the stream digest decides WHICH stream a result belongs
 * to. An entry appended above the cursor MOVES the digest and is still free, per
 * ADR-0034, so digest inequality is not a verdict and never stands in for one.

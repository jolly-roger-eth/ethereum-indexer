/**
 * A RECONFIGURE THAT CHANGED NOTHING COSTS NOTHING.
 *
 * The stream config is compared as a HASH, and the hash has to mean ONE thing.
 * `reinit` stored the digest of the RESOLVED config (`resolveStreamConfig` fills
 * `finality`), while `updateIndexer` digested the config exactly as the caller
 * PASSED it -- so a caller who left `finality` unset, which is the ordinary case
 * the resolver exists for, could never produce a matching hash. The verdict then
 * reported `reason: 'stream-config'`, which invalidates the STREAM half from
 * block 0 as well as the state half, so the fold was thrown away and the whole
 * history was re-fetched from the node for a reconfigure that moved nothing.
 *
 * Every claim here is asserted on the ADR-0034 PAIR -- what was DISCARDED and
 * what was RE-FETCHED -- because neither half can be read off the state: a
 * re-index and a resume land on identical rows.
 *
 * Both worlds are driven, and they say different things. WITH a stream cache the
 * re-fetch lands on the CACHE (the stored stream's own context was written
 * resolved, so it still matches), and what the bug costs is the fold: the state
 * is discarded and re-folded, and the published verdict lies. WITHOUT one there
 * is nothing to rebuild from, so the same discard is a full re-fetch from the
 * node -- which is the outage, and the only world where the RANGES can say so.

/**
 * A STREAM THAT CANNOT BE READ COSTS A RE-INDEX, NEVER THE INDEXER.
 *
 * The load path calls `fetchFrom` and `clear` with no `try`/`catch` anywhere
 * above them, so a keeper that raises from either does not degrade a cache: it
 * makes `load()` reject, for good, on every reload, for a LOCAL CACHE whose
 * correct recovery is to throw the bytes away and index again. That is the
 * outage story 12 exists to prevent.
 *
 * The rule already existed for the damage a keeper can DETECT (a gap, an
 * unparseable segment: cleared, absent reported, nothing thrown). This is the
 * same rule for the damage it cannot -- a substrate that is simply gone.
 *
 * `saveNewEvents` is deliberately NOT covered by it. See the last case.

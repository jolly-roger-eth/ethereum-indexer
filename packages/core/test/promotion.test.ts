// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PROMOTION POLICY: WHEN the canonical pointer moves, and what happens to
// the generation left behind.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The registry owns the pointer as a MECHANISM (move it, read it, move it
// back). This is the policy over it, and it has three values with ONE default
// EVERYWHERE:
//
//   on-catch-up (DEFAULT) -- the pointer moves when the successor reaches the
//                            cursor the canonical generation had (stories 1, 3, 14).
//   immediate   (OPT-IN)  -- canonical the moment it is created (story 13).
//   manual                -- it moves only when asked.
//
// There is deliberately no per-runtime and no per-environment default: the axis
// that would select one is DEVELOPMENT versus PRODUCTION, and nothing in a
// browser build can detect which it is in. So the safe value is the default and
// the dangerous one is a deliberate opt-in.
//
// Reads are asserted on the ANSWERS, never on identity: a read does not report
// which generation served it, so the two folds here MARK what they produce.

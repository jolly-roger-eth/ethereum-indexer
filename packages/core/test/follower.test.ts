// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A NON-CANONICAL GENERATION ADVANCES, AND HOW IT ADVANCES IS DETERMINED
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A generation is a stream plus a fold over it. WHETHER a second generation
// fetches is decided by whether it SHARES A STREAM with one already held, and by
// nothing else -- there is no knob here and there must never be one.
//
//   SAME stream  -> a FOLLOWER. It fetches NOTHING (zero, not fewer), writes no
//                   segment, re-folds the stored stream from the start and then
//                   follows it as the indexing generation appends.
//   OTHER stream -> an ordinary indexer at a different address. It fetches its
//                   own history, into its own keyspace.
//
// The zero matters for three reasons and the third is the load-bearing one: a
// follower with a poller of its own would make its state a function of ITS OWN
// FETCH rather than of the stream, so a later re-fold of the stored stream would
// yield a DIFFERENT state -- and a generation would stop being "a stream plus a
// fold over it", taking the exact-revert promise with it.

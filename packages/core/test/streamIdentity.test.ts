// A STREAM IS IDENTIFIED BY THE DIGEST OF ITS FILTER
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The digest is what a stream is ADDRESSED by, so every property here is about
// one of two failures, and they are not symmetric:
//
// - it MOVES when it should not: the stream forks, the whole history is
//   re-fetched and the old subtree is orphaned, silently;
// - it does NOT move when it should: one generation adopts another's stream
//   under a filter that does not match it, so logs are missing and nothing
//   reports it.
//
// The first is what the ORDERING trap causes (the entry list is sorted by
// `(startBlock, hash)` and `hash` covers the DECODING shape), and the second is
// what leaving the stream CONFIG out causes.

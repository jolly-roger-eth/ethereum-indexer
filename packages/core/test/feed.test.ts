// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The feed path must deliver retractions
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `feed()` is how a processor is driven from a FETCH this indexer did not make
// itself: a host hands over raw logs, complete over a range, and every retraction
// is derived here. (A stored STREAM, which carries its own, goes through
// `replay()` instead -- see `replay.test.ts` and ADR-0042. The kept-stream replay
// on load used to come through here, which is the defect that split them.)
// It used to batch the generated stream with `groupLogsPerBlock`, which SKIPS
// `removed` events because it is written for logs coming IN from a fetch, where
// a retraction has no business existing.
//
// On the way OUT to a processor a `removed` marker is the retraction itself, and
// it is the only instruction a processor ever gets to revert. Dropping it meant
// the very same stream produced two different states depending on which entry
// point delivered it: correct through `indexMore()`, silently derived from a
// dead branch through `feed()`.

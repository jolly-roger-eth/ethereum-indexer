// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AN EVENT IS NEVER SILENTLY DROPPED FROM THE FETCH FILTER
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `deleteDuplicateEvents` used to key on the event NAME, and the two call sites
// disagreed about what to do with a clash: the per-address merge threw, and the
// global list -- the one the fetch filter is built from -- spliced the second
// event out with no error, no log and no metric. Afterwards nothing could tell
// "the chain had none" from "we never asked", because the dropped event's
// topic0 was not in the filter to check with. That is the same failure class as
// `absence` vs `contradiction` in the reorg model, and as
// `SuspectedTruncationError`: an absence inferred from a request never made.
//
// So the assertions here are on the topics the fetcher REQUESTS, not on the ABI
// it accepted. What it accepted was never the thing that was wrong.
//
// The rule is now keyed on topic0 and is the SAME on both paths:
//
//   - different topic0  -> both events kept, whatever their names;
//   - same topic0, identical definition -> collapsed to one, no error;
//   - same topic0, different definition -> REFUSED at construction, naming the
//     events, because nothing on the wire can tell those two apart.

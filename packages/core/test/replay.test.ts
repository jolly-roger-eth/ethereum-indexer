// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A REPLAY honours the verdicts the stream already carries
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `feed()` takes a FETCH: raw logs, complete over a range, carrying no verdicts,
// so every retraction is derived from the cursor's unconfirmed WINDOW.
// `replay()` takes a STORED EMISSION STREAM, which already carries its own: the
// superseded events are in it, at their original block, flagged `removed`.
//
// Routing the second through the first is what this file pins shut. A rebuild
// starts from a fresh cursor whose window is EMPTY, so a stream containing a
// reorg was replayed with its retractions discarded -- both branches applied as
// live blocks, no revert anywhere -- and the window it left behind was missing
// the replacement block, so the very next tip cycle applied that block AGAIN.
//
// The claim asserted here is an EQUALITY against the live run, not an absence of
// throw: the same applies and reverts, in the same order, and the same cursor.

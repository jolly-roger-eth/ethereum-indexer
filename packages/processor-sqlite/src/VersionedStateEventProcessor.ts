 * is refused there, naming both numbers). `finalityDepth` is checked a second
 * time at `load`, against the finality the stream actually runs with; see
 * `EntityEventProcessor`'s `assertRetentionCoversReorgs` for why one number

/**
 * The SQLite flavour of `EntityEventProcessor`: build the store from a

 *
 * ## What is left of it, and what that says
 *
 * Almost nothing, and that is the point. Revert-then-apply, the block grouping,
 * read-your-writes, the version hash, the code fingerprint, the retention
 * reconciliation and the sync cursor all live once, in
 * `@etherfold/processor-entities`, written against `StateStore` and therefore
 * shared by every backend. Two copies of that logic -- one for SQLite and one
 * for everything else -- is exactly the drift the storage seam exists to
 * prevent, and this class exists to be the convenience it was always doing
 * alongside: `new VersionedStateEventProcessor(db, processor)` instead of
 * building a `VersionedStateStore` and passing it in.
 *
 * ## The two things it genuinely adds
 *
 * **A store from a database handle.** The neutral processor takes a
 * `StateStore`; this takes the `RemoteSQL` a server already has and constructs
 * one, with the deployment's retention validated where it was configured.
 *
 * **The SQL read tier.** `state` is a `VersionedStateView`, which is the seam's
 * four reads PLUS `queryCurrent` / `queryAsOf` (caller-supplied SQL) and block
 * addressing by hash and by time. Those exist here and are absent from
 * `EntityStateView` on purpose: a consumer that needs SQL predicates is told at
 * COMPILE time that a backend-neutral handle cannot give them, instead of by a
 * runtime throw in a browser tab. Choosing this class is choosing that tier.
 *
 * ## Revert is replay-free, and that is ADR-0001's revisit condition arriving
 *
 * The reasoning moved with the code, onto `EntityEventProcessor`. The observable
 * contract is unchanged here, and that is asserted rather than asserted-to:
 * `test/reorg.test.ts` runs the scenarios the retired in-memory path pinned, and
 * expects the same states.

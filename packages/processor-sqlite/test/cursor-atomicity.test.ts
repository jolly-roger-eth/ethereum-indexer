/**
 * The crash window, closed: on the SQLite path the cursor and the block it
 * describes move in ONE transaction, so a process that dies mid-stream comes
 * back with the two exactly in step.
 *
 * ## What used to happen, and why it was not a retry
 *
 * `process()` applied the stream and then wrote the cursor as a SEPARATE round
 * trip. Between the last `applyBlock` and that write there was a window in which
 * the STATE had advanced and the CURSOR had not, and it was not self-healing:
 * the restart resumes from the stale cursor, re-fetches blocks it already
 * applied, and `applyEventStream` only reverts when the stream carries a
 * retraction -- a plain replay has no fork point, so nothing reverts and
 * `applyBlock` is handed a block the store already holds. Every backend refuses
 * that BY DESIGN, correctly, because silently re-applying would double-write
 * versions. So the indexer did not merely redo work, it threw on every
 * subsequent start, and no amount of restarting cleared it.
 *
 * That was
 * `work/notes/observations/sync-cursor-write-is-not-atomic-with-the-block-it-describes.md`,
 * deleted with this change because it stopped being true.
 *
 * ## Why the fix has to be per BLOCK and not per `process` call
 *
 * One `process` call carries many blocks and each is its own transaction, so
 * writing the stream's cursor with the LAST block only would leave the same
 * window open for the whole run: crash after block 3 of 5 and the cursor is
 * still pre-stream. Each block therefore carries the cursor that describes IT
 * (`syncedThrough`), and the last carries the stream's own. The cases below kill
 * the database mid-stream and check both halves of the invariant: the cursor is
 * not behind the state (which wedges) and not ahead of it (which silently skips).

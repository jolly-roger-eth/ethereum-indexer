// The authoring types moved to `@etherfold/processor-entities` and this package
// re-exports them, `SQLProcessor` under its old name. Re-exporting a type is not
// the same as aliasing it, and the difference is invisible at runtime, so it is
// pinned here at COMPILE time: `pnpm typecheck` is what runs these assertions,
// and vitest only proves the same object still indexes.
//
// The mechanism, because the failure is otherwise unreadable: `EntityProcessor`
// is an intersection whose handler half is a mapped type with REMAPPED keys
// (`on${EventName}`), which offers no site to infer `ABI` from. TypeScript
// infers it anyway, but only through its shortcut for a source and a target that
// share an alias SYMBOL. `export type {EntityProcessor as SQLProcessor}` resolves
// to that same symbol; `export type SQLProcessor<ABI, C> = EntityProcessor<ABI, C>`
// declares a new one, the shortcut misses, `ABI` falls back to its `Abi`
// constraint, and every call below fails with an error about handler variance
// that names no cause. See the note on the export in `src/types.ts`.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE PROCESSOR, TWO DEPLOYMENT SHAPES
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// User story 12 of `work/specs/tasked/one-processor-everywhere.md`: the same
// processor and the same entity declarations, whether a deployment runs the
// single-process CLI or a split log-fetcher and indexer-server, so that scaling
// out is a deployment change and not a rewrite.
//
// The two shapes, in ADR-0003's vocabulary:
//
//   single-process  one process does all three. The LOG-FETCHER, the
//                   STREAM-BUILDER and the processor are the one
//                   `IndexerGeneration` driving `indexMore()` against a chain.
//                   This is what `etherfold serve` is, and it is the INTENDED
//                   CLI shape, not a violation.
//
//   split           two deployables. The log-fetcher is stateless and makes
//                   chain calls only; it pushes contiguous ranges of decoded
//                   logs across a wire. The indexer-server hosts the
//                   stream-builder and the processor, derives every reorg
//                   itself (ADR-0004: no reorg information crosses the wire),
//                   and never touches a chain.
//
// The sending half below is the SHIPPED `LogFetcher` (`@etherfold/core`), not a
// stand-in written here: a simulated sender can only ever prove that the
// simulation and the receiver agree. The receiving half is deliberately the
// engine's own `feed` behind a provider that refuses every call, because that is
// what arms check 1 below; the real receiving stack (`StreamBuilder`, the HTTP
// routes, a real database) is driven end to end in
// `packages/server/test/fetcherRoundTrip.test.ts`.
//
// ## Why a test and not an assurance
//
// The failure this file exists to prevent is silent. A convenience in the
// single-process path that reaches across the log-fetcher / indexer-server
// boundary breaks no test today; it is discovered the day somebody tries to pull
// the halves apart. So "the boundary is intact" has to be a thing that GOES RED,
// and it is encoded here in four ways:
//
//   1. **The receiving half is handed a provider that refuses.** Every JSON-RPC
//      method throws, naming the boundary. If the stream-builder / processor
//      half ever needs a chain call -- a block header, a receipt, even
//      `eth_chainId` -- it cannot be deployed away from the fetcher, and this
//      goes red at the call. That is what catches a convenience added on the
//      SINGLE-PROCESS side, which is where one would be added: the same
//      processor and the same core run both ways, so anything the CLI shape
//      quietly reaches for is reached for again here, against a provider that
//      will not answer.
//   2. **Everything that crosses the wire is JSON, and is asserted to survive
//      the crossing unchanged.** A convenience that smuggles a live object, a
//      class instance or a closure from the fetcher to the server goes red
//      structurally rather than eventually.
//   3. **The envelope is asserted to be ADR-0004's, and nothing more**: no
//      `removed` markers, no `unconfirmedBlocks`. If reorg information ever
//      starts being computed by the chain-facing side, the wire stops being a
//      wire.
//   4. **The RECEIVER is authoritative about the cursor.** The fetcher asks it
//      where the next batch must start, and a batch starting anywhere else is
//      refused with nothing applied. If the sender ever became authoritative,
//      the stateless component would have become stateful.
//
// ## Why the input is a replayed fixture
//
// Both shapes have to see IDENTICAL bytes, or an equality between them measures
// two chain reads rather than two deployments. `@etherfold/core`'s stream
// fixture is that: the chain is captured once, serialized once, and every run
// below re-parses the same text and replays it. `replayStream` itself is not
// used, because it builds an `ExistingStream` -- the kept-stream cache that sits
// in FRONT of a fetch -- and only the single-process shape has one; the split
// shape's fetcher needs a chain to fetch FROM. So the fixture is replayed one
// level lower, as the provider both shapes' chain-facing half talks to.

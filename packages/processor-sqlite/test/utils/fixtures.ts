/**
 * The SAME fixture as `ethereum-indexer-js-processor/test/reorg.test.ts`, ported
 * to versioned rows: one `Transfer(from, to, id)` event, an owner per token, and
 * a global transfer counter.
 *
 * The in-memory state there is `{owners: {[id]: string}, transferCount: number}`.
 * Here `owners` is the `token` table and `transferCount` is a single row in
 * `counter`, so every assertion in the mirrored tests can quote the SAME numbers
 * the in-memory tests quote. That is the point of the port: if the two paths
 * diverge, one of two files with the same scenarios goes red.
 *
 * `counter` also carries its weight beyond mirroring. It is an entity that the
 * reorged block touches while `token` may not, and vice versa, so it exercises
 * "reverting restores prior state for entities untouched by the reorged block"
 * and read-your-writes within a block (an increment must see the value an
 * earlier event in the same block wrote).

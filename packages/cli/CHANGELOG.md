## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- da289e2: A published snapshot a client cannot read is REFUSED, never installed as state — closing the last corner `tagged-bigint-codec-across-storage-adapters` left open knowingly (ADR-0040).

  The blob snapshot's format number now lives in `@etherfold/core` as `BLOB_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT`, beside the codec it versions, so the WRITER (`@etherfold/cli`'s keeper) and every READER import one number. It used to be the CLI's own `SNAPSHOT_FORMAT`, which the browser could not see (`@etherfold/browser` must not depend on the CLI and still bundles for a tab), so the CLI refused a format-1 file locally while `keepStateOnIndexedDB` installed the same bytes — whose every `uint256`, with no fallback reviver left, arrived as the string `"123n"` instead of a BigInt. `isReadableBlobSnapshot` and the `BlobSnapshotEnvelope` type are exported alongside it; the CLI no longer exports a format constant of its own.

  `keepStateOnIndexedDB` now checks the number on every remote fetch: an unreadable snapshot is refused whole (never translated, never half-read) and the refusal is logged with the location and both numbers. An unreadable mirror is treated exactly as an unreachable one already was — skipped when it loses selection, failed over from when it wins — and local state that is already ahead still wins over any remote, readable or not. A prefix-form mirror's bare `lastSync` file carries no format and is read as SELECTION data only: nothing from it is installed, and the state file it selects for carries the check.

  The ENTITY snapshot envelope's constant is renamed `ENTITY_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT` (`@etherfold/state-store`; re-exported by `@etherfold/processor-entities`) so the two envelopes — which version different file shapes and revise independently — are distinguishable by NAME at a call site that can hold both. They are not merged.

  Nothing is published under `@etherfold/*` yet, so no format-1 snapshot exists in the wild: this is a guard added before the first release rather than a breaking correction to one already shipped.

- f0f6e8d: One configuration path for every command: flags first, environment behind them, and a refusal that names both.

  The three entry points disagreed. The fetcher deployable read everything from the ENVIRONMENT and refused by name; the CLI read FLAGS and made requiredness a parser setting; the Node server host read two variables of its own. Now one module (`src/config.ts`) owns the whole flag-and-environment resolution for the CLI, both shipped commands run entirely off it, and the three commands that do not exist yet (`run`, `fetch`, `index`) already have their row in the same table.

  **`ETHEREUM_NODE` is RETIRED. The node URL variable is `ETH_NODE_URI`**, which is the name a fetcher deployable already refuses by, and it is now the only one. There is one name per input.

  ```sh
  ETHEREUM_NODE=https://rpc.example etherfold build …   # before
  ETH_NODE_URI=https://rpc.example etherfold build …    # after
  ```

  **`etherfold serve` now REFUSES to start without a database.** It resolves `--db`, then `DB`, and refuses naming both when neither is set, instead of falling through to the Node adapter's convenience default and creating an empty `./etherfold.db` nobody named. `@etherfold/platform-nodejs` is unchanged: the CLI passes the database it resolved explicitly, so that default is no longer reachable from a command.

  **Every input is resolved the same way, and there is one name for each (ADR-0048).** A flag beats the environment; the environment is used when the flag is absent; neither present is a refusal that names the flag AND the variable, made before the chain is dialled or a database is opened. The variables are the fetcher host's (`INDEXING_SOURCE`, `ETH_NODE_URI`, `INGEST_ENDPOINT`, `INGEST_TOKEN`, `REQUESTS_PER_SECOND`) plus the Node server host's (`DB`, `PORT`). The other six inputs (`-p`, `--store`, `--retention`, `-d`, `--host`, `--no-auto-setup`) are flags only: the environment carries what varies between deployments of one image, a flag carries what the image IS.

  **`INDEXING_SOURCE` now works on the CLI**, as the variable form of `-d, --deployments`: one JSON document, parsed and refused by field name. It resolves a source with NO chain call, which is what the wire receiver will need, since it makes none.

  **Nothing is accepted and ignored.** A flag a command does not own now PARSES and is refused with the reason it does not own it, rather than meeting `unknown option`: `etherfold serve -p ./processor.js` says that a read tier holds no processor and points at `index`, `run` and `build`. Those flags are hidden from `--help`, so the surface a user reads is still exactly what the command owns. An ambient VARIABLE a command does not own is not read at all rather than refused, so one host can run several commands side by side.

  **`--port` lost its commander default.** It was `'2000'` at the parser, which meant the flag was always present and `PORT` could never be reached. The default is now the resolver's, applied only when neither the flag nor the variable said anything. It is the only defaulted input.

  **`--rps` is parsed to a number.** It was typed as one and arrived as a string; a value that is not a positive number is now refused.

  **`prepareIndexing` takes the command name first**: `prepareIndexing('build', options, deps)`. `Options` now covers every flag any of the five commands takes, and every field on it is optional, because requiredness lives in the resolver and not in the parser. `resolveIndexOptions` is replaced by `resolveCommandConfig(command, options, env)`, which is exported along with the command table, the resolved shapes and `serve(options, deps)`.

- bb86a77: The free-form JS-object processor path is DELETED. There is one way to author a processor: entity declarations plus handlers over a `MutationContext` (ADR-0037).

  `@etherfold/js-processor` is gone, with `fromJSProcessor`, `JSProcessor`, `JSObjectEventProcessor` and its immer `History`. What it uniquely offered was an authoring STYLE, not a capability: no as-of queries, no retention or pruning, no bounded listing, and no schema for the query layer, which is generated from entity declarations. Its state was also a whole blob rewritten per save, which is the shape this repo has spent a design pass removing from the stream. What is NOT lost is its STORAGE characteristic: a plain object with history as immer reverse patches survives behind the proper seam as `@etherfold/state-store-patch` (the light store), with the capability reporting and conformance coverage the seam provides.

  **`@etherfold/browser`: one kind, one call shape.** `createIndexerState(processor)` takes the processor itself. The `ProcessorKind` / `TaggedProcessor` union, the bare `EventProcessorWithInitialState` form it also accepted, and the `keepState` option are removed, along with `keepStateOnIndexedDB` and `keepStateOnLocalStorage`. `updateProcessor` takes the same bare shape.

  ```ts
  // before
  const indexer = createIndexerState({kind: 'entities', processor: fromEntityProcessor(p)(store)});
  // after
  const indexer = createIndexerState(fromEntityProcessor(p)(store));
  ```

  **`@etherfold/core`: the `KeepState` family is deleted, snapshot half included.** `KeepState`, `ExistingStateFetcher`, `StateSaver`, `AllData`, `ProcessorContext` and `EventProcessorWithInitialState` go, and so does the BLOB snapshot envelope beside them (`BLOB_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT`, `BlobSnapshotEnvelope`, `isReadableBlobSnapshot`). The seam had exactly one caller, `JSObjectEventProcessor.keepState`, and its two masters turned out to be one: the entity path's bootstrap never used it. Installing state somebody else computed is `openSnapshotAware` / `bootstrapFromSnapshot` at the STORAGE seam, where a store's own transaction is, and `ENTITY_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT` is now the only envelope number. ADR-0040's rule (a format a reader cannot read is refused, never translated) is unaffected and is what the surviving reader still does.

  **`etherfold`: `--store` loses its `file` value and `--folder` goes with it.** `--store sqlite --db <libsql url>` is the whole of it, and `--store` stays required: it is the axis a second backend arrives on. `packages/cli/src/keepState.ts` (`createFileKeepState`, the blob snapshot writer) is deleted, and so is the kind/store mismatch refusal, which had nothing left to be a mismatch between.

  **`@etherfold/utils`: a module hands over the PROCESSOR, not a kind tag** (superseding ADR-0039). `createProcessor` returns the authoring object itself; `instantiateProcessorWithKind`, `ResolvedProcessor` and `ProcessorKind` are removed, and `instantiateProcessor` returns what the factory made, typed by the caller. A module still returning `{kind, processor}` is REFUSED naming ADR-0037, rather than unwrapped, so the retired shape cannot reach a store that would ask it for `entities` and get `undefined`. The `@etherfold/utils/indexer` subpath goes too: it existed for `contextFilenames`, the blob snapshot's file naming, and `@etherfold/browser` no longer depends on this package at all.

  **The stratagems conformance workload keeps its question and loses its regeneration.** The committed golden state is still what the ported entity processor is compared against on every backend, and the vendored original is still committed (typechecked, with its `JSProcessor` type vendored beside it). What is gone is `src/oracle.ts` and the `regenerate-golden-state` script, because driving that original needed `fromJSProcessor`: the golden is now a FROZEN expectation rather than a recomputable one. `CONTEXT.md` already treated a diff on it as a FINDING and not a fixture update, so regeneration was never the normal path.

  **Six example apps used the deleted path.** `event-processor-nfts` keeps only its entity processor (which the browser demo and `etherfold index` already ran) and is the end-to-end demonstration, beside `browser-reference`. `basic`, `event-processor-bleeps`, `event-processor-conquest-eth`, `event-processor-conquest-fplay` and `mud` are DELETED rather than left broken, and `web-demo` goes with them: it consumed three of them and rendered a state blob as a JSON tree, which is the shape the entity path does not have.

- 132cc1c: The one-shot is `etherfold build`, `serve` is only the read tier, and no command is implicit.

  **BREAKING, and it is the whole point.** `etherfold index` is gone and resolves to nothing: the word is needed for the wire receiver, which receives pushed batches, owns the database and does not terminate. The one-shot that folds to the tip and exits is now named for what it PRODUCES.

  ```sh
  etherfold index -p ./processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db   # before
  etherfold build -p ./processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db   # after
  ```

  **There is no DEFAULT command any more**, so a bare `etherfold …` now needs a command word: `etherfold -p ./processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db` was the one-shot and is now an unknown-option error. `etherfold` with nothing after it prints help and indexes nothing. The default existed so the rename from `ei` would not also cost users their argument order (ADR-0017); the name is changing anyway, and under a set of five names chosen so a reader can tell what a process will DO, an invocation that silently means one of them is the ambiguity the set exists to remove.

  Nothing about the pipeline moved. `build` keeps every flag (`-p`, `--store`, `--db`, `--retention`, `-d`, `-n`, `--rps`, and the `ETHEREUM_NODE` fallback), every refusal, the stop-at-tip driver and the exit codes (0 at the tip, non-zero on a refusal no waiting fixes). The package's exported `run(options)` is renamed to `build(options)` to match, and `main`'s injectable `run` collaborator becomes `build`, because `run` is a DIFFERENT command in the set being built (it follows the chain, answers queries and never terminates).

  **`serve` keeps its name and narrows its promise to serving.** It holds no processor, makes no chain call and writes no indexed state: it answers over a database something else wrote. That was already true of the code and not of the docs. It is now asserted rather than described: a server started the way `serve` starts one answers `501 ingestion-not-configured` on `/ingest` and `/ingest/expected-from-block` to an authenticated caller, while `/status` still answers, and an unauthenticated caller still gets `401` first, so the absence of a processor is not something an anonymous caller can probe.

### Minor Changes

- 0f33468: A NAMED INDEXER IS A ROUTE SEGMENT AND A REGISTRY ENTRY, on both halves of the wire.

  An indexer-server hosted exactly one indexer: `ServerOptions.getIngestion` resolved a single `LogIngestion`, and the ingest routes were the unnamespaced `/ingest` and `/ingest/expected-from-block`. It now hosts SEVERAL, each under a NAME an operator supplies at deploy time (ADR-0036).

  **`/{indexer}/ingest` and `/{indexer}/ingest/expected-from-block` replace the unnamespaced pair, which is GONE rather than kept beside them.** The name is a ROUTE SEGMENT and is deliberately NOT a field in the envelope: putting tenancy in the wire format would turn a misdirected batch into a payload error rather than a routing one. ADR-0004's `{source, config}` envelope and its refusal families (`409` resumable, `400` otherwise) are untouched.

  **`ServerOptions.getIndexer` replaces `getIngestion`, and resolves a registry ENTRY per name.** The entry is an object (`{ingestion}`) so that what a name holds can grow — a later generation model gives one entry several live wire contexts — without every host's resolver changing its return type. `indexerRegistry({name: streamBuilder})` builds one from a plain record for a host that knows its names up front; a host whose names depend on the request writes the function itself. Two named indexers on one server are isolated: a batch pushed to one is not visible to the other.

  **An unknown name is REFUSED, never defaulted: `404 unknown-indexer`.** A routing refusal, matching what the name is, and distinct from `501 ingestion-not-configured`, which a host with NO registry at all still answers under every name (a read tier, or a combined `run`). Both are in the non-retryable 4xx family a sender must not re-send into.

  **`createHttpIngestion` takes the indexer name beside the endpoint** (`@etherfold/core`) and posts to the namespaced routes; it refuses to be built without one rather than addressing nobody. `@etherfold/fetcher-host` reads it from `INDEXER_NAME` and demands it wherever it demands `INGEST_ENDPOINT` and `INGEST_TOKEN`, so a combined host that configures no wire is still asked for nothing.

  **The CLI grows `--indexer <name>` / `INDEXER_NAME`, REQUIRED on `fetch` and `index` and refused on `run`, `build` and `serve`.** The two halves of a split deployment agree on one name the way they already agree on one secret: `fetch` addresses `/{indexer}/ingest`, `index` registers exactly that name and refuses every other. The three commands with no wire route no batch by name, and refuse the flag with that reason rather than accepting and ignoring it.

  `StartOptions.getIngestion` on `@etherfold/platform-nodejs` becomes `getIndexer`, carried through unchanged as before.

- 8bb063e: The server's FIXED tables move into the reserved `_` namespace: `Meta` becomes `_meta` and `EmissionStream` becomes `_emissions` (with its indexes `_emissions_canonical` and `_emissions_by_address_topic`). Nothing about what they CONTAIN changes: same columns, same keys, same two indexes, same semantics.

  It closes a silent collision. Entity tables are created as `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "<entity.name>"`, and in every combined shape the store and the server share ONE database handle (`buildProcessor`), so a processor declaring an entity called `Meta` or `EmissionStream` issued that DDL against the SERVER's table: `IF NOT EXISTS` made it succeed silently, and the failure surfaced much later as a column error on a write, pointing nowhere near the declaration that caused it.

  The mechanism that closes it already existed, and the server's tables were simply outside it. `@etherfold/state-store` reserves the `_` prefix and refuses any entity inside it, and the store's own fixed tables already live there as `_blocks` and `_cursor`. Moving the server's two in makes the collision unreachable by CONSTRUCTION, with no new API, no dependency from the store to the server, and no widening of the entity legality rules. Parameterising the reserved set so a composing host declares its fixed names was considered and rejected: it grows optional API on the store for a guard that is off by default (a browser uses the store with no server at all) and relocates the discipline rather than removing it.

  The convention is now a GUARANTEE rather than a memory: a test scans `packages/server/src/schema/sql/db.sql` and fails if any table or index it creates does not begin with `_`, with a guard so an empty or unparsed scan cannot pass it. A fixed table added later without the prefix fails the gate instead of shipping a collision.

  There is NO migration and NO compatibility shim. The `schemaVersion` row lives in the table that was renamed, so a database migrated by an older build has no `_meta` and reports the schema as UNAPPLIED, which is the correct signal: those tables really did change. `SCHEMA_VERSION` therefore stays at `2` -- no database can hold a `_meta` row this build did not write.

  `EMISSION_STREAM_TABLE` still names the table for a host appending under a name it holds; its value is now `_emissions`. `@etherfold/state-store`'s reserved-identifier refusal is unchanged in behaviour, and its message and docstring now say the prefix means "not a user entity" rather than "the store's", since two packages place tables there. The CLI's reorg counters write to `_meta`.

- 56acbef: Every deployment shape counts the reorgs it concluded, not only the one behind an HTTP route.

  `etherfold run` reverted state on a reorg correctly and then reported `{absence: 0, contradiction: 0}` on `/status` for ever, because the counter was written by the HTTP ingest route and a combined process folds through the direct in-process wire and never touches it. `etherfold build` had no `Meta` table at all. So an operational counter was a fact about the TRANSPORT, and the shape the milestone calls the default was the one that could not report it. Nothing was mis-indexed: the fold was already correct in both shapes, and the equivalence suite proved it. What was missing was the observability, on the one `/status` field the two shapes did not agree about.

  **The count is taken where the reorg is CONCLUDED, and written by whoever OWNS the store** (ADR-0050). `StreamBuilder.receive` reports a concluded revert to a `ReorgRecorder` exactly once, whichever entrance the batch arrived through, and the deployment that opened the database supplies that recorder. The ingest route is a CALLER of `receive` now rather than the owner of a write, so a receiver that both concludes a revert and serves the request that carried it counts it once, and `run`, `build` and `index` all count.
  - **`@etherfold/core`** gains `ReorgRecorder`, `ReorgCounters`, `RecordedReorg` and the durable key names (`REORG_COUNTER_KEY`, `REORG_LAST_KEY`), plus `StreamBuilderOptions.recordReorg`. The keys live here because the writer and the reader are deliberately in different packages: a read tier owns no store and still has to answer "how many reverts does this database record". `recordReorg` is not hashed into the wire identity, since where a count goes is not something a sender asserts. `IngestionOutcome.reorg` is unchanged and is REPORTED rather than delegated: a caller that counted from it would count only on the shape it happens to be, and twice on the shape that is both.
  - **`@etherfold/server`** no longer exports `recordReorg` and writes no counters. It reads them (`readReorgCounters`) for `/status`, including on a read tier that folds nothing, and `ReorgCounters` is re-exported from core. Its dependency posture is unchanged: it still owns no store package.
  - **`@etherfold/platform-nodejs`** exports `ensureFixedSchema(db)`, the auto-setup step `startServer` already performed, so a process that binds no port can still create the fixed tables.
  - **`etherfold`** owns the one writer (`recordReorg`, `reorgRecorderFor`), built by `buildProcessor` against the handle the command folds into, so no folding command can count into a database it does not fold into. **`build` applies the fixed-table schema**, which it never did: it binds no port, so nothing else ever would, and a database it emits is a publishable ARTIFACT that must carry its provenance the moment it becomes an INPUT rather than an output.

  **A counter that cannot be persisted never takes down a fold or a request**, on any shape. That guarantee belonged to the route (`recordReorgSafely`); it lives in `StreamBuilder` now, so it is owed by every shape that counts.

  `packages/cli/test/equivalence.test.ts` drops the exception it carried and compares the `/status` counters between `run` and `fetch` plus `index` directly, through the reorg it already drives: the same counts, the same classification, the same block, and once each. `packages/core/test/oneReorgWriteSite.test.ts` scans the workspace and asserts there is no second site recording a reorg.

- 70af4e1: `etherfold fetch` runs the chain-facing half of a split deployment, and it is now the ONLY way to run a fetcher.

  ```sh
  etherfold fetch -n https://rpc.example -d ./deployments --ingest-endpoint https://indexer.example
  ```

  It follows the chain and pushes contiguous ranges of raw logs at an indexer-server elsewhere, so splitting a deployment stays a deployment decision rather than a rewrite: run this near your node, and the folding half anywhere.

  **It is a FRONT DOOR, not a new deployable.** `@etherfold/platform-nodejs-fetcher` already shipped the loop, the signals and the exit code; what it did not have was a flag surface, because it was configured from the environment alone. So this command resolves through the same path as every other one (flags first, environment behind them, one name per input), opens the source, and hands the five inputs an operator configures to that adapter as overrides:

  | flag                | variable              |                                                                                                         |
  | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `-n, --node-url`    | `ETH_NODE_URI`        | the chain to read                                                                                       |
  | `-d, --deployments` | `INDEXING_SOURCE`     | what to index. REQUIRED in one form or the other: there is no processor module to read contracts out of |
  | `--ingest-endpoint` | `INGEST_ENDPOINT`     | the indexer-server to push to                                                                           |
  | `--ingest-token`    | `INGEST_TOKEN`        | the wire's shared secret                                                                                |
  | `--rps`             | `REQUESTS_PER_SECOND` | the rate limit on the node                                                                              |

  Everything else a fetcher deployment tunes (`SUSPECT_RESULT_COUNT`, the fetch bounds, the backoff, the stream identity) stays in the environment the fetcher host already publishes, rather than growing a second name here.
  - **It owns no state, and says so instead of ignoring the flags that imply otherwise.** `--store` and `--db` are REFUSED (a fetcher holds no cursor and no database, ADR-0003), `-p` is refused (the chain-facing half holds no processor; whatever folds these logs lives behind `--ingest-endpoint`), and `--port` / `--host` are refused (it pushes to an HTTP surface, it does not answer one). A missing node URL, source, endpoint or token is a refusal naming the flag AND the variable, raised before the chain is dialled.
  - **There is nowhere to remember a block number**: no state file, no lock file, no `--from-block`. Progress across restarts comes from the receiver's cursor and from nothing else, and the `409` on the next start is the recovery.
  - **How it ends is the adapter's answer, taken whole** (`runFetcherProcess`): `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` let the cycle in flight finish and exit `0`; a refusal no waiting fixes exits non-zero, because a fetcher that stays up while achieving nothing is indistinguishable from a working one until somebody reads the state it is not producing; everything else is retried on the escalating, capped backoff.
  - **The CLI is the process now**, so it is what hooks the `named-logs` facade to the console for a fetch run -- the job the retired `etherfold-fetch` binary used to do, and one that a library must not do for an application embedding it.

  New API: **`fetch`** (resolve, open the source and start the loop; returns the adapter's handle), **`fetchMain`** (the process shape, exiting on the code the adapter resolved) and **`prepareFetching`** (this command's row of the table, in the shape `startFetcher` takes).

- 74f74f5: `etherfold index` runs an ENTITY processor into a store, so the same processor object a browser tab indexes with also indexes on a server.

  ```sh
  etherfold index -p ./processor.js --store file   --folder ./state          # free-form, unchanged
  etherfold index -p ./processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db  # entity path, new
  ```

  **`--store` is required and is never defaulted.** The two answers are not interchangeable: `file` keeps a free-form state blob with no history, `sqlite` keeps versioned entity rows that answer as-of reads, survive a reorg, and hold the sync cursor in the same transaction as the block it describes (ADR-0027). A default would hide that difference at the moment a deployment picks. `--db <libsql url>` accompanies `sqlite`, `--folder` accompanies `file`, and each is REFUSED with the other store rather than accepted and ignored. `--retention <blocks|revert-only|unbounded>` is settable on the sqlite arm; nothing prunes inside the index loop, because pruning is a call a host schedules (ADR-0022).

  **The processor KIND comes from the MODULE, not from a flag** (ADR-0039). `createProcessor` returns `{kind: 'entities', processor}` — the same two words and the same shape `@etherfold/browser` takes — and an UNTAGGED module still means `'js-object'`, so every existing CLI invocation keeps working unchanged. A kind/store mismatch is refused at startup naming both, before any RPC call. `@etherfold/utils` gains `instantiateProcessorWithKind` and `ResolvedProcessor` for that; `instantiateProcessor` is unchanged for its existing callers except that it now unwraps a `'js-object'` tag and refuses an `'entities'` module instead of returning something that is not an `EventProcessor`.

  **The engine underneath changed, and `EthereumIndexer` is no longer constructed anywhere in the CLI.** The command now folds through the two ADR-0003 halves with the transport removed — `LogFetcher` → `createDirectIngestion` → `StreamBuilder` → the processor — driven by `runFetcherLoop` plus an `AbortController` that stops at the tip, so the one-shot exits `0` at the tip and non-zero on a refusal no waiting fixes (a foreign `{source, config}`, the wrong chain, a suspected truncation). That is one server-side folding engine rather than two, which is what makes "the split is a deployment choice" testable rather than a claim about two implementations that agree today. It also brings the fetch cycle's machinery to the CLI: announced AND silent truncation detection, the cursor-correction protocol, backoff, and the five-report classification. `EthereumIndexer` is untouched and remains the browser's engine.

  Breaking, and cheap because nothing is published yet:
  - `--store` is now required, so an existing `etherfold index -p … -f …` invocation gains `--store file`;
  - `indexToTip` and `init` are gone from `etherfold`'s module exports, replaced by `prepareIndexing` (which returns the assembled pipeline plus an `index()` that drives it to the tip) and `run`;
  - `@etherfold/core` exports `resolveStreamConfig`, so a host can size a store's retention floor against the finality the stream actually runs with instead of restating the default and silently forking the wire's config hash.

- 1de190f: `etherfold index` receives a pushed stream, owns the database, and completes the five-name command set.

  ```sh
  etherfold index -p ./dist/processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db -d ./deployments
  ```

  The half a split deployment was missing. The chain-facing half has been runnable all along (`etherfold fetch`); what nothing assembled was a server that HOLDS a processor, so a pushed batch met a `501` and a split deployment had a sender and no receiver. This is that receiver: it folds batches another process pushed to it, through the same stream-builder, the same entity processor and the same versioned store `run` folds through, on ONE libSQL handle it also hands to the server. So a split deployment is `index` plus `serve` against one database, and the shape falls out of the command set instead of needing to be explained.

  **It exposes the WRITE path and not the query API, and that asymmetry is the point.** It has an HTTP surface because it must RECEIVE pushes; answering queries is `serve`'s. `/status` is available because there is an HTTP surface, and it reports on the database rather than on the process -- including the cursor, through the same injected reporter `run` builds, which is what makes a split deployment observable.
  - **It makes NO chain call, and that constrains how it resolves its source.** There is no provider in this path, no log-fetcher and no fetcher host. `-n` / `--rps` are REFUSED naming what this command is instead, and the source must be given EXPLICITLY (`-d`, or `INDEXING_SOURCE` as JSON): the wire identity is derived from the source and the stream config together, so a source resolved by asking a node which chain it is on could not be the sender's. A processor module whose contracts are keyed per chain is refused by name, naming both explicit forms, rather than quietly costing an `eth_chainId`.
  - **It authenticates or it refuses everyone.** `--ingest-token` (`INGEST_TOKEN`, which is preferable) is REQUIRED, so a receiver with no secret configured never binds a port rather than coming up as a write endpoint that answers `401` to a sender with no way to know why. A wrong secret is a `401` naming the variable, and nothing is applied.
  - **It is idempotent by cursor, because the cursor IS the idempotency key.** A batch that does not start at the receiver's own `expectedFromBlock` is refused with a `409` carrying that value, and the sender re-sends from there; a sender that fell behind is corrected with no operator involved, and a replayed batch cannot be applied twice.
  - **It owns its database.** The store's tables are created BEFORE a port is bound, so an illegal entity declaration or a retention window that does not cover what a reorg can reach is a refusal that never starts, rather than a `500` to a sender on a process still reporting itself healthy. The server's fixed-table schema is applied at startup as it is for every Node host; `--no-auto-setup` takes that back.
  - **It does not terminate.** A receiver has no tip to stop at -- what it folds arrives from somewhere else -- so it ends on `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` with exit code `0`, and exits `1` only when it could not start at all.

  **The split is now a deployment CHOICE rather than a second implementation, and that is asserted at the COMMANDS.** `run` and `fetch` plus `index` fold the same processor and the same entity declarations over the same fixture chain -- including a reorg whose replacement branch carries FEWER events -- and land on identical state and an identical cursor, with the transport as the only difference. `index` plus `serve` against one database answer what `run` answers, through the read surface generated from the entity declarations and on the `/status` fields the server derives from the database. `serve` reports no cursor, which is correct rather than a bug: the cursor reaches `/status` only through an injected reporter, and a read tier owns no store.

  New API: **`index`** (assemble the receiver and start answering; returns a handle carrying the url, the one database handle, the store, the processor and the stream-builder), **`indexMain`** (the process shape, resolving the exit code), and the shared folding assembly every command that owns a database now builds through (**`buildProcessor`**, **`openExplicitSource`**, **`STREAM_CONFIG`**).

- 0fd7dc9: `etherfold run` follows a chain, folds a processor into SQLite and answers HTTP, in ONE process.

  The command the whole set exists for, and the default thing to reach for. One terminal invocation, no knowledge required of how the components divide:

  ```sh
  etherfold run -p ./dist/processor.js --store sqlite --db file:./etherfold.db -n https://rpc.example --port 2000
  ```

  **It is ASSEMBLY, and every part of it already shipped.** A log-fetcher pushing into a stream-builder through the in-process direct ingestion (the two ADR-0003 halves with the transport removed), the stream-builder folding an entity processor into a versioned state store, that store's libSQL handle handed to the server as its database, and the whole thing driven by the fetcher host's loop. It is the SAME assembly `build` uses — one `prepareIndexing`, one `driveCycles` — with one difference: `build` aborts on the first report that reached the tip, and `run` does not. No component is implemented twice, and the browser's engine is constructed nowhere in the command path.
  - **It does not stop at the tip.** It backs off to the poll interval and keeps following. Stopping is a SIGNAL (exit `0`, with the cycle in flight allowed to finish), or a refusal no waiting fixes (non-zero), and nothing else. A retryable failure is retried indefinitely on the escalating, capped backoff rather than after N attempts, so a transient node outage does not leave a stopped indexer behind.
  - **It serves, on the handle it folds into.** One database, built once by the command: the store writes through it and the server answers over it, rather than two connections with two views of it.
  - **`/status` reports a cursor that ADVANCES**, through the `getCursorReport` seam: `{lastFromBlock, lastToBlock, latestBlock, unconfirmedBlocks}`. Four numbers and never the stored cursor itself, which is a serialized sync structure carrying a window of decoded events — `/status` reports what a host hands it verbatim (ADR-0047), so bounding it is the host's job.
  - **A `run` process hosts no remote writer.** It fetches for itself, so no ingestion capability is injected into its server: an authenticated call to `/ingest` answers `501 ingestion-not-configured`, an unauthenticated one still answers `401`, and `--ingest-endpoint` / `--ingest-token` are refused because there is no wire to configure. The command that receives pushes is `index`.
  - Every input resolves through the same configuration path as the other commands (flags first, environment behind them), and a missing node URL, database or processor is a refusal naming the flag AND the variable, raised before the chain is dialled, a database is opened or a port is bound.

  New API on `etherfold`: **`run`** (assemble, serve and start following; returns a handle with `url`, `db`, `store`, `stopped` and `stop()`), **`runMain`** (the process shape, resolving the exit code) and **`readCursorReport`**. `PreparedIndexing` gained `db` (the one handle) and `config` (the command's resolved row), and its `index()` now follows the tip when the command is `run`.

  `@etherfold/platform-nodejs-fetcher` exports **`stopOnSignals(controller)`**, the signal half of `startFetcher` on its own, so a combined process that drives its own loop stops on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` through the same answer rather than a second copy of it.

### Patch Changes

- afd3da9: `etherfold run` and `etherfold build` no longer refuse to start when `STREAM_FINALITY` is set, and every command now HONOURS the environment's stream settings instead of half-ignoring them.

  The resolved stream config is hashed into the wire identity, so the sending `LogFetcher` and the receiving `StreamBuilder` must reach the same one. `resolveFetcherHostConfig` read three settings from the environment (`STREAM_FINALITY`, `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TIMESTAMPS`, `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TRANSACTIONS`) and then merged the caller's override OVER them. The commands that hold both halves in one process passed a hard-coded empty override, and spreading `{}` cannot remove a key the environment has already put there: the sender resolved `finality: 25` while the receiver resolved the default `17`, the digests could never match, and `WireContextMismatchError` is not retryable, so the process exited.

  The split deployment failed the same way and worse, because there the operator is told the two halves must agree: `etherfold fetch` honoured `STREAM_FINALITY` while `etherfold index` was pinned to the default, so setting it on both hosts, which is what a careful operator does, made every push refused.

  The stream config is now derived ONCE from the environment (`streamConfigFromEnv`, newly exported from `@etherfold/fetcher-host`) and handed to both halves, and an override REPLACES the environment's config rather than merging over it, because a spread can add a key but can never say "no finality here".

  The fix deliberately keeps the variable working rather than making both halves ignore it. Agreeing by ignoring would have satisfied the digest comparison while silently discarding a documented setting, and this CLI's rule is that nothing is accepted and ignored. The combined shape and the split shape now read one environment the same way.

  `STREAM_CONFIG`, previously exported from `etherfold`, is replaced by `streamConfigFor(env)`. It could not remain a constant: the value depends on the environment.

- 1d9be43: Every caller, example and doc now names the GENERATION container: `IndexerGeneration` for one stream plus one fold, and the two FACTORIES for the browser hook.

  This is the MIGRATE batch of the expand → migrate → contract rename the generation container needs. Nothing is removed: `EthereumIndexer` is still exported from `@etherfold/core` as an alias to `IndexerGeneration`, and `createIndexerState` still accepts a processor built over a store. What changed is that nothing in this repository reaches for either any more, so `the-old-indexer-shape-is-deleted` can delete both without a compile error anywhere.

  **`@etherfold/browser` re-exports the class as `IndexerGeneration`, not `EthereumIndexer`.** A caller that imported the type from this package renames the import; the class itself is unchanged, and `@etherfold/core` still exports the old name for now.

  **The browser hook is written against `{createState, createProcessor}` everywhere.** The README, both example apps, the `IndexerState` and `BrowserStateStore` JSDoc examples and every test now hand over the two factories rather than a processor already built over a store:

  ```ts
  const indexer = createIndexerState({
  	createState: () => createBrowserStateStore(myProcessor.entities, {databaseName: 'my-app'}),
  	createProcessor: (store) => fromEntityProcessor(myProcessor)(store),
  });
  ```

  An indexer holds any number of generations and each folds into its OWN state, so the store cannot be a value handed over once — the hook is what calls these, once per generation. An app that needs the store it built (to rebuild a processor over it on a hot reload, or to read its capability report) captures it in the factory's own closure, which is what both examples now do.

  **The CLI's source-text guard is asserted to still bite.** `packages/cli/test/engine.test.ts` enforces that the CLI constructs and imports no browser engine by matching the identifier with regexes. A rename that left those on a name nothing uses any more would keep them green and VACUOUS — enforcing nothing, with nothing going red to say so — so the patterns are now named functions and are asserted against deliberate violations under BOTH spellings, plus the prose and the generation CONTAINER they must not fire on.

- 1a6f68b: Every published package now carries a `description` and its own `README.md`.

  Metadata and docs only: no runtime code changed. Four manifests had no `description` at all (`@etherfold/core`, `@etherfold/browser`, `etherfold`, `@etherfold/utils`), which is the line npm shows in search results and on the package page, and seven packages had no README (the four above plus `@etherfold/server`, `@etherfold/platform-nodejs` and the private Worker host). Each README says what the package is, when to reach for it INSTEAD of its neighbours, a minimal snippet taken from code that runs, and links to the related packages.

  Two summaries are worth calling out because a guessed one would have been wrong. **`etherfold index` is a ONE-SHOT**: it folds to the tip it observed and exits, does not follow the chain and cannot be reconfigured while running, so keeping a database current is running it again; live reconfigure is `@etherfold/browser`'s ability. And **`@etherfold/utils` is not a bag of hashing helpers** any more: what is in it is the Node-side loader that turns a processor PATH into the authoring object plus its indexing source, since `contextFilenames` and the `@etherfold/utils/indexer` subpath went with the blob snapshot (ADR-0037).

  One existing description is CORRECTED rather than added: `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite` called itself a "state store for `@etherfold/core`", which names the wrong seam. It depends on `@etherfold/state-store`, `remote-sql` and `named-logs` and on nothing else, and a test in that package asserts as much, because a storage backend depending on the indexer would invert ADR-0016.

  **`etherfold` no longer publishes the repo's root README.** Its `prepack` copied `../../README.md` into the package, so the npm page for the CLI described the monorepo and documented none of its flags; the package now has a README of its own, committed rather than generated, and `prepack` copies only the LICENSE.

- 0bf9dc7: Package READMEs now link to sibling packages by absolute URL instead of by relative path.

  A README is read in three places and a relative `../state-store` link is only correct in one of them. On npmjs.com it resolves against the registry page and 404s, so every cross-reference in every published README was broken for the audience most likely to follow one. In the generated API documentation the same links became `_media/<package>` references to files that do not exist, which is what turned the docs site's build red.

  No prose changed; only the link targets.

- c0d694f: The acceptance gate no longer assumes an idle machine: every package that runs vitest sets `testTimeout` and `hookTimeout` to 60s instead of inheriting the 5s default.

  No runtime code changes in any of these packages. The bump is only because each gained (or had amended) a `vitest.config.ts`.

  Vitest's 5s default is fine on an idle box and wrong on a machine someone is working on. The gate runs `pnpm test` across the whole workspace, so suites compete with each other and with everything else running. Three unrelated packages timed out at 5s in a single session -- `core`'s base36 digest sweep, four cases in `state-store-sqlite`'s conformance suite, and `server`'s `sql2ts` round-trip -- each passing in seconds when run alone, and each blocking a task that had nothing to do with the code that failed.

  That makes a red gate ambiguous, which defeats the point of having one: red should mean broken, not "someone opened a browser". A generous timeout costs nothing when tests pass, since it is only reached on failure.

  The base36 digest sweep in `@etherfold/core`, skipped earlier the same day, is un-skipped: raising the timeout is the fix that skip was standing in for.

  See ADR-0032 for the rejected alternatives, including why a shared config file is not possible here (per-package `rootDir` puts `vitest.config.ts` under the typechecker, so importing a root-level file fails `TS6059`).

- b824312: **BREAKING: `EthereumIndexer` and the one-generation call shape are DELETED.** There is one name and one call shape. Nothing is kept as an alias, a shim or a deprecation window: nothing is published and the only consumers are repositories we own, so a compatibility path would be a second way to reach what the first one exists to replace.

  This is the CONTRACT batch of the expand → migrate → contract rename the generation container needed. `the-generation-container-expands-beside-the-old-shape` landed the container beside the old shape; `every-caller-moves-onto-the-generation-container` moved every caller, example, README and test onto it; this removes what nothing reads.

  **`@etherfold/core` no longer exports `EthereumIndexer`.** The class is `IndexerGeneration` — one stream, one processor, one state IS a generation, and an **indexer** is the `Indexer` container that holds several and points at the one that answers reads. An import of the old name is a compile error; rename it.

  **`createIndexerState` (`@etherfold/browser`) takes the two FACTORIES a generation is built from, and nothing else.** The shape that was handed one already-built processor over one already-built store is gone:

  ```ts
  // gone
  createIndexerState(fromEntityProcessor(myProcessor)(store));

  // the only shape
  createIndexerState({
  	createState: () => createBrowserStateStore(myProcessor.entities, {databaseName: 'my-app'}),
  	createProcessor: (store) => fromEntityProcessor(myProcessor)(store),
  });
  ```

  An indexer holds any number of generations and each folds into its OWN state, so the store cannot be a value handed over once. A caller that needs the store it built (to rebuild a processor over it on a hot reload, or to read its capability report) captures it in the factory's own closure.

  **A DISCARD IS NOW PUBLISHED BY THE CONTAINER, not by the browser hook.** `Indexer.reset`, `updateIndexer` and `updateProcessor` drop the handle the discarded fold had published and re-announce through `onStateUpdated`, so a subscriber holding the state that just went is told at the moment it goes. This is not new behaviour, it is the same re-seed one level lower: `createIndexerState` did it for its own `state` store, which is deleted here, and the container is what knows a verb discarded. It reaches every consumer of a container now rather than the browser hook's subscribers alone.

  `etherfold` (the CLI) changes only in its own source-text guard, which enforces that the CLI folds through `StreamBuilder` and constructs no browser engine. The guard matched the class under BOTH spellings while the alias existed; with one name left it matches one, and the deliberate violations it is asserted against lose their alias half — a guard left on an identifier nothing can resolve any more would stay green and enforce nothing.

  The verbs still discard exactly when they discarded before. Turning a reconfigure into a NEW GENERATION over the same stream, so nothing is discarded in place at all, is the promotion policy's landable (`the-promotion-policy-moves-the-canonical-pointer`) and needs the shared-stream follower under it.

  **The guard against a rebuild being reported as empty moved down with it.** When the STREAM survives — which a processor swap always leaves it, since the stream verdict is about the source and the config and not the processor — the `load` inside the verb replays the cached events and publishes the rebuilt state before the verb returns. The container counts that publication and stays silent rather than announcing an empty fold over the top of it.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 047cd73: Switch the build from `tsup` to `tsc` and ship ESM-only output. The CommonJS build (`dist/*.cjs`) and the `main` field have been removed; packages are now consumed via the `module`/`exports` ESM entrypoints only. Module resolution moves to `NodeNext` (relative imports now carry explicit `.js` extensions, JSON imports use import attributes).
- bc5d71a: Update all dependencies to their latest versions and fix the resulting build.

  Dependency updates (notable):
  - `viem` 1.x → `^2.52.0` (major), `abitype` → `^1.2.4`
  - `pouchdb` / `pouchdb-find` → `^9.0.0`, `commander` → `^15.0.0`, `koa` → `^3.2.1`
  - `typescript` → `^6.0.3`, `vitest` → `^4.1.8`, plus various `@types/*`, `eip-1193`, `named-logs`, `fs-extra`, etc.

  Fixes required by the updates:
  - `@etherfold/core`: handle viem v2's stricter `encodeEventTopics` return type (`(Hex | Hex[] | null)[]`) and the generic `eventName` returned by `decodeEventLog` over `AbiEvent[]`.
  - `@etherfold/browser`: align `LastSync`/`ExistingStream` generic vs. base `Abi` usage that broke under viem v2's tighter `DecodeEventLogReturnType`.
  - `@etherfold/fs-cache`: spread typed event args safely; make the package explicitly ESM (`type: module`) with `.js` import extensions.
  - All published packages: add a standard `exports` map (ESM-only, no `main`) so modern bundlers/test runners (Vite/Vitest v4) resolve the package entry correctly.

  JS processor authoring keeps full ABI-derived type safety (`event.args` typed from the ABI).

- 086de7b: Adds the platform-agnostic indexer-server and its Node host, and a `serve` command to the CLI.

  `@etherfold/server` is a Hono app that receives its database and environment by injection (`{getDB, getEnv}`) and imports no runtime: no Node built-ins, no Cloudflare types, no concrete driver. It ships the fixed-table schema and a `/status` route reporting database reachability, whether the schema is applied and at which version, and the last error this process saw. `POST /admin/setup` applies the schema. A test asserts the package names no runtime, so the property is checked rather than trusted.

  `@etherfold/platform-nodejs` is the Node host: a libSQL-backed `RemoteSQL`, environment from the process, served over HTTP. It applies the schema at startup by default (one process owning one file), which `autoSetup: false` disables.

  The CLI gains `etherfold serve`, which runs that host, so a project can start an indexer-server without wiring anything. `etherfold index` remains the default command, so existing `etherfold -p <processor> -f <folder>` invocations are unchanged.

  A Cloudflare Worker host also exists, at `platforms/cf-worker`, and is not published: it is a deployable, not a library.

  The server is a skeleton. It serves status and schema only: no chain logic, no store wiring, no feed. Those arrive with the tasks that follow ADR-0003.

- e0e5832: Renamed to the `@etherfold` scope (ADR-0017). `ethereum-indexer` is now `@etherfold/core`, and `ethereum-indexer-browser`, `-js-processor`, `-fs`, `-fs-cache` and `-utils` are now `@etherfold/browser`, `@etherfold/js-processor`, `@etherfold/fs`, `@etherfold/fs-cache` and `@etherfold/utils`. The two previously unpublished `@ethereum-indexer/*` packages move to `@etherfold/*`.

  The CLI is the one exception to the scope: `ethereum-indexer-cli` becomes the flat package **`etherfold`**, because it is the package that installs the `etherfold` command.

  No API changed: update the package name in your imports and the exports are identical.

  **You must migrate to keep receiving updates.** There is no re-export shim under the old names, so nothing further will be published as `ethereum-indexer*` and no version of an old name forwards to the new one. Already-published versions stay installable indefinitely, so existing pins keep resolving, but they are frozen.

  **The CLI command is renamed**: the CLI installs `etherfold` instead of `ei`, so `npm i -g etherfold` then `etherfold -p <processor>`. Update any script that shells out to `ei`.

  `named-logs` namespaces follow the package names, so any log filter matching `ethereum-indexer*` needs updating to `@etherfold/*`. The CLI is the exception: its namespaces follow the command, so `ei` and `ei:keepState` become `etherfold` and `etherfold:keepState`.

  `ethereum-indexer-server` and `ethereum-indexer-db-utils` are deliberately NOT renamed: both are on the retirement path set by ADR-0010, and they have since moved to `archive/` in the repository, outside the workspace. Their published versions stay installable and are not deprecated here.

- 0ac08c0: **One BigInt convention, and it identifies a BigInt instead of guessing at one.** Every storage adapter now tags: `{"__bigint__": "123"}`, the codec the wire and the sync cursor already used. **`bnReplacer`, `bnReviver` and `isBigIntLiteral` are removed from `@etherfold/core`**, and `bnReviver` is removed from `@etherfold/browser`.

  `"123n"` was both what `123n` serializes to and a perfectly legal string for a contract to emit, so the decoder could not tell them apart and silently changed the type of whichever it got wrong. That is silent in both directions: a real BigInt read back as a string breaks arithmetic downstream, a string read back as a BigInt breaks comparisons (including `===` against a hash) and JSON round-trips. It is not hypothetical, and both kinds genuinely coexist in one payload: `LastSync.unconfirmedBlocks` carries decoded `LogEvent`s whose `args` hold a BigInt per `uint256`, and the same document carries the `context` digests. `535ccc1` stopped that decoder THROWING on values that were never numbers and gave `simple_hash` a leading `h`; both were containment, and the guess itself is what this removes.

  Moved onto the tag: **`etherfold`**'s snapshot keeper, **`@etherfold/browser`**'s `keepStateOnIndexedDB` and `keepStateOnLocalStorage`, **`@etherfold/fs`**'s file keeper, and `@etherfold/core`'s captured stream fixture. `@etherfold/processor-entities` was already on it.

  **The legacy suffix form is not read, anywhere, and there is no fallback.** Translating it would be the same guess under a new name, and refusing every string of digits ending in `n` would refuse legitimate event data, so a `"123n"` string is now simply a string. Where a persisted artifact carries a FORMAT number the number was bumped instead, so a file written under the old convention is refused AS A FILE rather than half-decoded:
  - **`STREAM_FIXTURE_FORMAT` is 2.** `parseStreamFixture` refuses a format-1 fixture, naming the file.
  - **`etherfold`'s `SNAPSHOT_FORMAT` is 2, and older snapshots are no longer read.** A snapshot at format 1, or in the bare pre-envelope form, is logged and treated as absent, which cold starts. That is deliberate: its BigInts cannot be recovered by this reader, so resuming from it would resume from state whose every `uint256` had become a string, and re-indexing is the existing recovery for a snapshot that cannot be read. Delete the snapshot folder, or re-index once.
  - The two artifacts with no format number of their own -- `@etherfold/fs`'s keeper blob and `keepStateOnLocalStorage`'s -- are caches whose recovery is a re-index, so a stale one reads back with its BigInts as the `"123n"` strings they now are. Call `clear()`, or clear site data.

  `keepStateOnIndexedDB` needed the codec only on its REMOTE reads: the local half hands the object to `idb-keyval`, and IndexedDB's structured clone stores a BigInt as a BigInt.

  The `"123n"` rendering survives in exactly one place, `simple_hash`, which uses it to have bytes to hash. Nothing decodes those bytes, so there is no guess to make, and changing it would change every digest ever persisted.

### Patch Changes

- 535ccc1: Stop the `"123n"` BigInt convention from mangling the hashes stored beside it.

  Six copies of the same reviver decided a string was a BigInt by testing its FIRST and LAST character, then called `BigInt()` on everything in between:

  ```ts
  (v.startsWith('-') ? !isNaN(parseInt(v.charAt(1))) : !isNaN(parseInt(v.charAt(0)))) && v.charAt(v.length - 1) === 'n';
  ```

  That admits `1x9tbhn`, which is not a BigInt literal but an ordinary base36 `simple_hash` digest, and `context.processor`, `context.config` and `context.source[].hash` are all made of those. `BigInt('1x9tbh')` throws, from inside `JSON.parse`. In the CLI, whose `keepState.fetch` catches parse failures, that meant a perfectly good snapshot being read as corrupt and the whole state re-indexed from scratch, permanently, for roughly 1.25% of config hashes, with a log line blaming the file. The copies without a `try/catch` simply threw.
  - The predicate now lives once, in `@etherfold/core` as `isBigIntLiteral` (with `bnReplacer` / `bnReviver` beside it), and every live copy uses it: the CLI, both browser adapters (including `keepStateOnIndexedDB`, the in-browser path ADR-0002 calls primary) and the fs adapter. A dead copy in `@etherfold/js-processor`'s `history.ts` was deleted.
  - **`simple_hash` now prefixes every digest with `h`, so all hashes change.** A guard cannot rescue a digest of all digits ending in `n` (`8918n`), because that genuinely IS the convention's shape: such a digest came back from storage as a BigInt, and `processorHash === context.processor` then compared a string to a BigInt and discarded state that was fine. The prefix makes the shape unreachable instead of unlikely.
  - **`simple_hash` no longer drops falsy values.** It filtered with a bare `if (value)`, so `{fee: 0}` hashed identically to `{}` and `{enabled: false}` identically to `{}`: a config change to a falsy value could not invalidate the state computed under the old one. `undefined` is still dropped, matching `JSON.stringify`, so a value hashed before and after a round trip still agree.
  - `simple_hash` also accepts BigInt values instead of throwing on them, which a processor config holding a `uint256` would previously have done.

  The suffix convention itself is still a guess: it cannot distinguish a real BigInt from a contract-emitted string that reads like one. `@etherfold/processor-sqlite`'s tagged `{__bigint__: "..."}` codec is the form that can, and is where the remaining adapters should go.

- 5af5f04: Write the snapshot state file atomically. Previously `keepState.save` wrote the `state` and `lastSync` files in place via `fs.writeFileSync` on every `indexMore()`, so a process killed mid-write (CI timeout, OOM, Ctrl-C) could leave a truncated, invalid-JSON snapshot on disk — which a CI snapshot pipeline could then commit and publish. The save now writes each file to a temp file in the same directory, fsyncs, and renames it over the destination (atomic on POSIX same-filesystem), cleaning up the temp file on failure. An interrupted save now leaves the previous valid snapshot intact.

  Internally, the file-backed `keepState` implementation was extracted from `init()` into an exported `createFileKeepState(folder)` (behaviour-preserving) so it can be unit-tested.

- 41370f7: The CLI now resolves a proper process exit code: `0` on success and `1` on failure. Previously `cli.ts` did `run().then(() => console.log('DONE'))` with no `.catch` and no `process.exit`, so a failed index (bad node URL, RPC error, processor throw, write failure) could look like a successful CI step — and on success the process could linger because the provider's rate-limit timers kept the event loop alive. The success/failure-to-exit-code logic is encapsulated in an exported `main(options, deps?)` (with injectable `run`/`exit`/`log`/`error` for testing); `cli.ts` calls it with the real `process.exit`. On failure the error is reported and `DONE` is not printed.
- 39ae6ca: Make the CLI's indexing loop resilient and drop a redundant RPC call. The `run()` loop previously made a standalone `eth_blockNumber` request at startup (immediately made redundant by `indexMore()`, which re-fetches and returns the latest block) and had no retry — a single transient `indexMore()` error (e.g. an RPC blip) aborted the whole batch. The loop is now extracted into an exported, testable `indexToTip(indexer, opts?)` that discovers the tip via `indexMore()` alone and retries transient errors with a bounded number of attempts (default 5) before giving up. Termination contract is unchanged: it indexes up to the live chain tip (suitable for the snapshot-behind-finality use case).
- b1fe882: Add a versioned envelope to the snapshot state file and stop silently swallowing corrupt snapshots. The state file is now written as `{format, processor, savedAt, lastSync, state, history}` (the `processor` is the processor version hash from the lastSync context, `savedAt` is an ISO timestamp). This is backward-compatible: reads accept both the new enveloped form and the legacy bare `{lastSync, state, history}` form, and `state`/`lastSync`/`history` remain at the top level so existing consumers keep working. On read, a missing file is still treated as a normal first run, but a file that exists yet cannot be read or parsed (e.g. truncated by an old non-atomic write, or a bad commit) is now logged via `named-logs` instead of being silently treated as "no snapshot".
- 47252ad: Rewrite `init()` to use the new shared processor/source-resolution helpers from `@etherfold/utils` (`loadProcessorModule` + `instantiateProcessor` + `resolveSource`) instead of its own copy of that logic (LOW-4 in the server/CLI batch audit). Behaviour is preserved exactly: the CLI still constructs its own rate-limited `JSONRPCHTTPProvider`, owns its `keepState` wiring, calls the processor factory with no argument, and — importantly — keeps the original ordering (instantiate processor + `keepState` check happen before any `eth_chainId` RPC). As a side effect the CLI now also benefits from the `createRequire(...).resolve()` module-resolution fallback the server already had.

  (The CLI uses the granular helpers rather than the bundled `resolveProcessorAndSource` precisely to preserve that ordering; the server uses the bundled helper since it has no equivalent intermediate check.)

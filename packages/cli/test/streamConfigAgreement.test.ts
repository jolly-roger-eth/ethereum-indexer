// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TWO HALVES MUST REACH THE SAME STREAM CONFIG FROM THE SAME ENVIRONMENT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The RESOLVED stream config is hashed into the wire identity, so a sending
// `LogFetcher` and a receiving `StreamBuilder` that disagree cannot talk at all:
// the receiver refuses the batch with a `WireContextMismatchError`, which is not
// retryable, so the process exits rather than degrading.
//
// The environment owns three stream settings (`STREAM_FINALITY`,
// `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TIMESTAMPS`, `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TRANSACTIONS`) and the
// commands that hold BOTH halves in one process (`run`, `build`) have to hand
// the same resolved config to each. The failure this pins is that they did not:
// the sender derived its config from the environment while the receiver was
// given a hard-coded empty one, so setting `STREAM_FINALITY` -- the documented
// way to configure it -- made every one of those commands refuse to start.
//
// A merge cannot express this, which is why the fix is a single derivation
// handed to both: an override that spreads OVER the environment can add a key
// but can never say "no finality here", so an empty override read as "use the
// default" was indistinguishable from an absent one.

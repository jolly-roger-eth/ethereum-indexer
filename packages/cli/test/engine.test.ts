// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THERE IS ONE SERVER-SIDE FOLDING ENGINE, AND IT IS NOT `IndexerGeneration`
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `work/specs/tasked/one-command-runs-the-whole-pipeline.md` builds `run` and
// `index` on the same `StreamBuilder` and asserts they produce identical state
// from the same input. That assertion is worth making only if the transport is
// the only difference between them: if this command folded through
// `IndexerGeneration` instead, the equivalence would be between two
// IMPLEMENTATIONS that happen to agree today, and every later divergence would
// surface as a mysteriously failing equivalence test rather than as a bug in one
// place.
//
// So it is asserted rather than claimed, by reading this package's own sources.
// A grep is crude and it is the right shape here: what must not exist is a
// construction, and the file that would introduce one is the file this reads.
// That engine stays the browser's.
//
// IT HAS ONE NAME AGAIN, AND THE GUARD MATCHES THAT ONE. The class is
// `IndexerGeneration` -- one stream, one processor, one state IS a GENERATION --
// and the second spelling it carried through the rename was deleted with the old
// shape (`the-old-indexer-shape-is-deleted`), so that spelling came out of the
// patterns below with it. A guard left on an identifier nothing can resolve any
// more would stay GREEN and enforce nothing, which is worse than no guard.
// Deliberately NOT extended to `Indexer`, the generation CONTAINER: whether a
// CLI holds generations is `the-server-and-cli-hold-generations-too`'s question,
// and a grep here must not pre-answer it.
//
// A SOURCE-TEXT GUARD IS ONLY WORTH ITS LINES IF IT STILL BITES, so the patterns
// are named here and asserted against deliberate violations below. A rename that
// left them on an identifier nothing uses any more would keep them green and
// VACUOUS -- passing forever, enforcing nothing, with nothing going red to say
// so. That is the one failure mode this file cannot detect by reading `src/`,
// because `src/` is clean either way.

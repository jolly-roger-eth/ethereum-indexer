// real `StreamBuilder` over the same entity processor the rest of these tests
// fold, on a real local libSQL database -- reached through an in-process `fetch`
// rather than a socket, exactly as `packages/fetcher-host/test/harness.ts` and
// `packages/server/test/fetcherRoundTrip.test.ts` do it. Only the NODE is fake.
//
// A mocked receiver would mock the thing under test: what the command must get
// right is that the cursor lives HERE, so the `409` that puts a restarted
// fetcher back on track has to come from the real endpoint.

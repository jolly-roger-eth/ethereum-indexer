// `etherfold index`: THE RECEIVING HALF, AS A COMMAND
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The half a split deployment was missing. `fetch` has been runnable all along;
// what nothing assembled was a server that HOLDS a processor, so a pushed batch
// met a `501` and a split deployment had a sender and no receiver.
//
// It is driven here THE WAY THE SUBCOMMAND DRIVES IT -- `index(options, deps)`
// is what the registered action reaches through `indexMain` -- and everything
// below it is the shipped thing: a real libSQL database, a real HTTP server on a
// real port, the real `StreamBuilder` -> `EntityEventProcessor` ->
// `VersionedStateStore` chain, and on the other end of the wire the real
// `etherfold fetch` command pushing over a real socket. Only the NODE is fake,
// and it is fake on the SENDER's side, which is the only side that has one.
//
// ## The structural claim this file rests on: there is no chain here
//
// `IndexDependencies` has no `provider`, because this command's path constructs
// none: it builds no `LogFetcher` and no fetcher host, and its source can only
// be an explicit one. That is asserted below in the two places it is
// observable -- `-n` is refused by name, and a source that could only be read
// out of a processor module (which costs an `eth_chainId` call) is refused
// naming both explicit forms -- rather than left to inspection.

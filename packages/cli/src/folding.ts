// THE FOLDING ASSEMBLY EVERY COMMAND THAT OWNS A DATABASE SHARES
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Three of the five commands fold: `run` and `build` fetch what they fold,
// `index` receives it. What differs between them is where the batches come
// FROM -- a `LogFetcher` on this side of a direct in-process wire, or a sender
// on the other side of an HTTP one -- and what is IDENTICAL is everything below
// the stream-builder: one stream configuration, one store, one processor, one
// database handle. So it lives here rather than in any one command's module,
// which is the file-level form of "no component is implemented twice".
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The stream configuration every command indexes under, DERIVED ONCE from the
 * environment and handed to both halves.
 *
 * The RESOLVED object is hashed into the wire identity, so a sending
 * `LogFetcher` and a receiving `StreamBuilder` must reach the same `finality`
 * from the same input. Its resolved form is also what the entity store's
 * retention floor is checked against, which is why nothing here writes a
 * finality number of its own.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function of the environment and not a constant
 *
 * It was `const STREAM_CONFIG = {}`, on the reasoning that an empty config makes
 * both halves take the same default. That held only while nothing else fed the
 * config. The fetcher host reads three settings from the environment
 * (`STREAM_FINALITY`, `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TIMESTAMPS`,
 * `STREAM_ALWAYS_FETCH_TRANSACTIONS`) and merged the caller's override OVER
 * them -- and a spread of `{}` cannot remove a key the environment has already
 * put there. So the sender resolved `STREAM_FINALITY` and the receiver resolved
 * the default, the two digests could never match, and `run` and `build` refused
 * to start on any host that set the documented variable.
 *
 * Deriving here fixes it in the direction that keeps the variable WORKING: both
 * halves honour it, rather than agreeing by both ignoring it, which would have
 * satisfied the hash while silently discarding a documented setting (and this
 * repo's rule is that nothing is accepted and ignored). It also means the
 * combined shape and the split shape read one environment the same way.

/**
 * Turn a source ORIGIN a chain-free command resolved into the source itself.
 *
 * Two arms and no third, which is the type talking: the module route is the only
 * one that can cost an `eth_chainId` call, so a command that makes no chain call
 * has already refused it by name (`requireExplicitSource`). Both `fetch` (no
 * processor module to read a source out of) and `index` (no node to ask) land
 * here, for different reasons and on the same two arms.

/**
 * Build the `EventProcessor` a stream-builder drives, plus the store it writes
 * to, the ONE database handle underneath both, and the recorder that counts what
 * a reorg did to them.
 *
 * The handle is returned rather than kept, because a command that also serves
 * hands this SAME object to the server (`platforms/nodejs`'s `StartOptions.db`
 * takes one): the store and the read surface then see one database rather than
 * two connections with two views of it -- against `:memory:` they would not even
 * be the same database.
 *
 * ## Why the reorg recorder is built HERE
 *
 * Because this is where the store is OWNED, and a concluded reorg is counted by
 * whoever owns the store (ADR-0050). All three folding commands come through
 * this function, so all three count, and none of them can bind the recorder to a
 * different database than the one they fold into. `run` used to count nothing at
 * all, because the write lived on an HTTP route a combined process never
 * touches.
 *
 * The imports are dynamic so that a command which never opens a database does
 * not pay for libSQL, matching how `serve` keeps the server's dependency tree
 * off `build`.

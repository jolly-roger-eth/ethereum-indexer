 * ## Why this and not `IndexerGeneration`
 *
 * Because there is one server-side folding engine or there are two.
 * `work/specs/tasked/one-command-runs-the-whole-pipeline.md` builds `run` and
 * `index` on the same `StreamBuilder` and asserts they produce identical state
 * from the same input; that assertion is worth making only if the transport is
 * the only difference between them. Folding here through a second engine would
 * turn it into an equivalence between two IMPLEMENTATIONS that happen to agree
 * today. `IndexerGeneration` also cannot be split into halves at all (it opens
 * `load()` with `eth_chainId`, which is why the chain-free `StreamBuilder`
 * exists), and what it has that a server does not want is the kept-stream CACHE:
 * here the folder or the database IS the durable artifact. It stays the
 * browser's engine and is not constructed anywhere in this path.
 *
 * ## The order of what happens here is part of the contract
 *
 * The processor is loaded and the state destination is built -- both BEFORE the
 * source is resolved, which is the first thing that can touch the chain. So a
 * module this command cannot drive, or a store it cannot open, fails without
 * first issuing `eth_chainId`.

 *

 * means another sender moved the cursor, and stopping there would report success

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `etherfold index`: THE FOLDING HALF, RECEIVING A PUSHED STREAM AND OWNING THE DATABASE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The half a split deployment was missing. The chain-facing half has been
// runnable all along (`etherfold fetch`); what nothing assembled was a server
// that HOLDS a processor, so a pushed batch met a `501` and the split had a
// sender and no receiver.
//
// This is that receiver: it folds batches another process pushed to it, through
// the same `StreamBuilder` -> `EntityEventProcessor` -> `VersionedStateStore`
// chain `run` folds through, on ONE libSQL handle it also hands to the server.
// So `run` and `fetch` plus `index` are the same components with the transport
// as the only difference, which is what makes the split a DEPLOYMENT CHOICE
// rather than a second implementation.
//
// Four things define it, and each is a constraint rather than a feature:
//
//  1. **It makes NO chain call**, anywhere in this path. There is no provider
//     here, no `LogFetcher` and no fetcher host, which is why its source must be
//     given EXPLICITLY: the wire identity is derived from the source and the
//     stream config together, so a source resolved by asking a node which chain
//     it is on could not be the sender's. A processor module whose contracts are
//     keyed per chain is therefore refused by name (`requireExplicitSource`),
//     naming the two explicit forms, rather than quietly costing an
//     `eth_chainId`.
//  2. **It exposes the WRITE path and not the query API**, and that asymmetry is
//     the point: a split deployment is `index` plus `serve` against ONE
//     database, the writer and a stateless read tier, and that shape falls out
//     of the command set instead of needing to be explained. `/status` is
//     available because there is an HTTP surface, and it reports on the DATABASE
//     rather than on the process.
//  3. **It authenticates or it refuses everyone.** The shared secret is REQUIRED
//     (`src/config.ts`), so a receiver with none configured never binds a port:
//     the guard on `/{indexer}/ingest` fails closed, and a process that came up
//     regardless would be an endpoint answering `401` to a sender that had no
//     way to know why. The secret this command resolved is passed to the host
//     rather than left to the ambient environment, so the flag and the variable
//     mean the same thing here as they do on `fetch`.
//  4. **It does not terminate.** A receiver has no tip to stop at -- what it
//     folds arrives from somewhere else -- so it ends on a signal, exactly as
//     `run` does, and never on a report.
//  5. **It hosts a NAMED INDEXER**, and the name is the operator's
//     (`--indexer`, `INDEXER_NAME`): this process registers exactly the one name
//     it was given, and every other is refused with a `404` rather than served
//     by the only indexer this host happens to hold (ADR-0036). ONE name per
//     process is what this command builds today; a host registering SEVERAL is a
//     registry with more entries in it and no change to the route
//     (`ServerOptions.getIndexer`).

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `etherfold run`: ONE PROCESS THAT FOLLOWS, FOLDS AND ANSWERS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The command the whole command set exists for (`CONTEXT.md`, "The COMBINED
// deployment is the milestone; the SPLIT is a deployment choice"). It is
// ASSEMBLY and nothing else: the two ADR-0003 halves wired together in one
// process by `createDirectIngestion`, folding through the same `StreamBuilder` a
// split deployment receives into, over the same store, on ONE libSQL handle --
// all of which is `prepareIndexing`, shared verbatim with the one-shot.
//
// `run` is that assembly with TWO differences and no third:
//
//  1. **It does not stop at the tip.** The abort the one-shot fires from its
//     first caught-up or idle report is not fired here (`driveCycles`,
//     `src/index.ts`), so it follows the tip and backs off to the poll interval
//     when there is nothing above the cursor. Stopping is a SIGNAL, not a report.
//  2. **It serves.** The server starts on the handle the store folds into, with a
//     cursor reporter that reads that store, so `/status` reports a cursor that
//     ADVANCES while the process runs.
//
// And one thing it deliberately does NOT do: it injects no registry of named
// indexers into its server. A remote sender pushing into a process that is
// already fetching for itself would be a second writer nobody asked for, so the
// namespaced ingestion routes
// answer `501` to an authenticated caller exactly as the read tier's do (`401`
// to an unauthenticated one: the token guard sits on the PATH, ahead of the
// capability lookup, so the absence of a processor is not something an anonymous
// caller can probe). The command for receiving pushes is `index`.

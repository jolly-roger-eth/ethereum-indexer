// ONE CONFIGURATION PATH FOR EVERY COMMAND (ADR-0048)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Moving between the five commands is a DEPLOYMENT change and never a rewrite,
// and that is a property of this file. Every command reads the same inputs, under
// the same flag and the same variable, through the same resolver, and refuses in
// the same shape.
//
// The rules, none of them negotiable:
//
//  - **A flag beats the environment**, the environment is used when the flag is
//    absent, and neither present is a REFUSAL rather than a default. There are
//    exactly three defaults in this file and each says why it is one.
//  - **ONE name per input.** The variables are the fetcher host's, because it
//    already refuses by name and those names are the published contract of a
//    deployable, plus the two the Node server adapter already reads. The CLI's
//    own second name for the node URL (`ETHEREUM_NODE`) is RETIRED here.
//  - **Requiredness lives here and not in the parser**, so every refusal is a
//    function a test can call over an options object and an environment record.
//  - **A refusal names the flag AND the variable** that would have satisfied it.
//  - **Nothing is accepted and ignored.** An accepted-and-ignored flag is a
//    deployment believing something untrue -- a node URL nothing dials, a store
//    nothing writes -- so an input a command does not OWN is refused with the
//    reason it does not own it.
//
// One deliberate asymmetry inside that last rule: what is refused is a FLAG a
// user typed, never an ambient VARIABLE. `ETH_NODE_URI` set on a host that runs
// `fetch` and `index` side by side is ordinary, and refusing `index` because the
// machine also has a node URL would make the split deployment this system is FOR
// impossible to configure. So a command reads only the variables it owns and
// leaves the rest alone.

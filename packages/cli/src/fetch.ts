// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `etherfold fetch`: THE CHAIN-FACING HALF, AND THE ONLY WAY TO RUN ONE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A FRONT DOOR, not a new deployable. `platforms/nodejs-fetcher` already ships
// the whole thing -- the loop, the signals a container sends, the exit code --
// and what it did not have is a flag surface, because it was configured from the
// environment only. So this module is the translation and nothing else: resolve
// this command's row of the table (flags first, environment behind them), open
// the source it named, and hand the answer to the adapter as the overrides it
// already takes.
//
// The standalone `etherfold-fetch` binary is RETIRED in the same change, which
// is what makes this the ONE way to run a fetcher. The adapter survives as a
// LIBRARY, exactly as `platforms/nodejs` already does: no binary, and the CLI
// imports its start function.
//
// What this command does NOT own, and each absence is a decision:
//
//  - **No processor**, ever: the chain-facing half holds none (ADR-0003). Its
//    source is therefore always an EXPLICIT one, since there is no module to
//    read contracts out of.
//  - **No store and no database**, so `--store` and `--db` are REFUSED rather
//    than accepted and ignored (`src/config.ts`).
//  - **Nowhere to remember a block number.** No state file, no lock file, no
//    from-block: progress across restarts comes from the receiver's cursor and
//    from nothing else (ADR-0004), and the `409` on the next start is the
//    recovery.

/**
 * What only THIS backend can be asked about pruning.
 *
 * That a prune must never drop a live version, and what a windowed store may
 * drop, is the seam's contract and is asserted for every backend by the shared
 * suite. What is asserted here is HOW: the closed versions live in their own
 * index, because a live version's `upper` is `null` and `null` is not a valid
 * IndexedDB key, so the row that IS the current state cannot be reached from the
 * prune at all. The spike's prototype pruned by scanning every version and
 * testing a predicate (6.3 s at 62,553 versions, in
 * `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md`); this one walks a range.

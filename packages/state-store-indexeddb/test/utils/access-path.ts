/**
 * What the store ASKED IndexedDB for, recorded so it can be asserted.
 *
 * The behaviour of a listing (ascending id order, the limit, `truncated`,
 * as-of) is the seam's and is asserted for every backend by
 * `@etherfold/state-store-conformance`. What only this backend can be asked is
 * the ACCESS PATH, and no amount of behavioural testing can see the difference
 * between a bounded range scan and a scan of the whole store that filters and
 * sorts afterwards: both return the same rows.
 *
 * So the requests themselves are recorded. This is the IndexedDB equivalent of
 * `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`, which is what `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite` pins its
 * listing with.

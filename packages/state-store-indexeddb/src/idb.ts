/**
 * The three lines of IndexedDB plumbing every method here needs, and nothing
 * more.
 *
 * IndexedDB is an event API, and a store written against it directly reads as
 * callbacks inside callbacks. These wrappers turn a request into a promise and a
 * transaction into a promise, which is safe for exactly one reason worth stating
 * because getting it wrong is silent: awaiting a promise that is resolved from
 * an IndexedDB event handler continues in the SAME microtask checkpoint, so the
 * transaction is still active and further requests may be made on it. Awaiting
 * anything else (a fetch, a timer, another transaction) lets the transaction
 * auto-commit underneath the code that thinks it still owns it, and a
 * half-applied block or a half-reverted reorg is the worst outcome this store
 * has.
 *
 * So: inside a transaction, await only the helpers in this file.

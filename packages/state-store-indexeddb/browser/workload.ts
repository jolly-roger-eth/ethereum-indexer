/**
 * One processor, written once against the seam, run on the server and in a tab.
 *
 * This module is imported by BOTH sides of the browser tests: the Playwright
 * spec runs it in node against `MemoryStateStore`, and the bundled
 * code-under-test runs the SAME object in the browser against
 * `IndexedDBStateStore`. Nothing in it names a backend, which is the property
 * the whole storage seam exists for, and comparing the two results is how "the
 * same processor runs everywhere" becomes a fact rather than a claim.
 *
 * The `Transfer(from, to, id)` fixture is the one the other backends' tests use,
 * so the suites quote the same numbers. `counter` earns its place twice: it
 * makes read-your-writes observable inside a block, and it is the accumulated
 * value that must go back DOWN when the reorg below is reverted.

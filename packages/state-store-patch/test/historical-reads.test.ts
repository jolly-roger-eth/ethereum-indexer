/**
 * The single failure mode this backend exists to prevent: a historical read
 * answered from the tip.
 *
 * It is worse than an error because it is PLAUSIBLE. A refusal is a thing a
 * caller handles; a tip value served as "the state at block N" is a number
 * nothing downstream can tell apart from a true one, and it is exactly what a
 * caller would get today from a light store that has no concept of history.
 *
 * So the assertions come in two kinds. The behavioural ones ask for history at
 * every depth there is and require a typed refusal each time. The structural one
 * reads the source of the two as-of methods and requires that they touch no
 * state at all, because "it refuses today" is a property a later edit can
 * remove by accident and "it cannot read" is not.

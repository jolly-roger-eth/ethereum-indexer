/**
 * The case this backend exists for, on the stream shape it will actually meet.
 *
 * A dense fixture (consecutive block numbers) makes this store look like a
 * time machine: `work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md` replayed
 * backwards on one and matched the recorded state at every depth to 64, on four
 * runtimes. A real contract does not produce one. On the launched stratagems
 * game on Base, event-bearing blocks are median **429 blocks apart**, and
 * history here is pruned by BLOCK-NUMBER distance from the tip, so at a finality
 * depth of 64 exactly ONE block's reversals survive: the tip's.
 *
 * So the stream below is sparse, at that measured median, and the three facts
 * asserted are the whole capability: backwards replay is CORRECT wherever the
 * patches exist, a revert inside the finality depth still reverses a counter
 * DOWN after a prune, and a revert deeper than the surviving patches is REFUSED
 * rather than approximated.

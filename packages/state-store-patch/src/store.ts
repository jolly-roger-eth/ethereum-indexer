/**
 * The light `StateStore`: current state as a plain object, history as immer
 * reverse patches, reorg revert by replaying them backwards.
 *
 * It is the cheapest legitimate implementation of the seam. A browser tab that
 * only needs current state and reorg safety pays nothing for versioned rows,
 * while running the SAME processor as the server: hand this store to
 * `@etherfold/processor-entities` in place of `@etherfold/state-store-sqlite`
 * and the handlers do not change, because a handler writes through
 * `MutationContext` and names no backend.
 *
 * ## It advertises `revert-only`, and that is a measured result
 *
 * Not a limitation to apologise for and not a cost problem. Backwards replay is
 * CORRECT wherever the patches exist: the finding
 * (`work/notes/findings/sqlite-in-the-browser.md`) replayed a dense stream
 * backwards and matched the recorded state at every depth to 64, on Chromium,
 * Firefox, WebKit and node, at a cost linear in depth (126 ms at depth 64 on a
 * laptop).
 *
 * What removes the capability is SPARSITY. History is pruned by BLOCK-NUMBER
 * distance from the tip (`tip - finalityDepth`, the one comparison the seam
 * prunes on), while a real stream carries only event-bearing blocks, which on
 * the launched stratagems game on Base are median **429 blocks apart**. At a
 * finality of 64, exactly ONE block's reversals survive: the tip's. So there is
 * nothing left to replay for an as-of read, and no tuning returns it: raising
 * the depth past the finality it protects would be inventing a window this
 * representation cannot honour on the next contract.
 *
 * Hence: `revertTo` works and is the reason this backend exists, every as-of
 * read is a `BlockNotRetainedError`, and the report says `revert-only` rather
 * than a window. The patch log's SIZE follows the same fact -- 1,702 KB (223% of
 * the state) on a dense synthetic stream, 4.4 KB (1% of it) on the real one,
 * because almost everything is pruned immediately.
 *
 * ## Memory-only, and it says so
 *
 * State and patches both live in the process and go with it. Persisting them is
 * a decision this store deliberately does not make: serialising the whole state
 * blob on every save is the incumbent `keepStateOnIndexedDB` strategy, which
 * belongs to the `KeepState` seam ABOVE this one, and row-level persistence is
 * `indexeddb-row-backend-browser-default`'s job. `capabilities.durability` says
 * `memory-only` so a caller learns it at startup, and a reload is an empty store
 * that must re-index (or hydrate from a snapshot). See ADR-0023.
 *
 * ## What it is NOT
 *
 * Not `MemoryStateStore`, which keeps VERSIONED ROWS in a Map and can therefore
 * answer as-of reads: that one is the executable definition of the seam, this
 * one is the cheap deployment. Not the incumbent light path either, which has no
 * concept of history at all and would answer a historical read from the tip --
 * the single failure mode this design exists to prevent, and worse than an error
 * because it is plausible.

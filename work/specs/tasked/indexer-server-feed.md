title: Indexer-server log feed (the stored emission stream and the two views over it)
slug: indexer-server-feed
taskedAfter: [historical-state-database, a-reconfigure-is-not-an-outage]

> Launch snapshot, records intent at creation, NOT maintained. Current truth: `docs/adr/` (decisions) + the code; remaining work: `work/tasks/ready/` tasks.

> **MOVED BACK to `specs/proposed/` on 2026-09-01, because `ready/` MEANS taskable and this spec is not.** It carries `taskedAfter: [historical-state-database, a-reconfigure-is-not-an-outage]` and the second of those is still in `specs/proposed/`, so residence in the auto-task pool was a claim the frontmatter contradicts. Left there it invited exactly the outcome the Implementation Decisions spend three paragraphs preventing: a tasker emitting the emission table keyed on a stream digest that does not exist yet.
>
> **The edge is a CHOICE and can be broken deliberately, which is the useful half.** As the `taskedAfter` justification below already records, it rests on building the digest rule ONCE rather than on migration cost: with no data and no consumers this table could legitimately be built on a placeholder key and re-keyed later. So if the server tier needs to move before the browser generation model does, drop the `a-reconfigure-is-not-an-outage` edge and accept a second digest implementation (or a placeholder), rather than moving this file back into `ready/` with the edge still on it.

> Split out of `historical-state-database` at tasking time. That spec's user stories cover state queries, the ingestion wire and running serverlessly. The scope here (storing the log stream and serving it as a feed) arrived later, via `docs/adr/0006`, and is not covered by any of its stories. Tasking is atomic per spec, so this scope becomes its own spec rather than being smuggled into that one.

> **NARROWED: the REBUILD is no longer here.** Stories 9-11 moved to `work/specs/proposed/the-server-and-cli-hold-generations-too.md`, which supersedes them (see the note where they were). This spec owns the STORAGE and the FEED and nothing about upgrades; that spec is `taskedAfter` this one because it consumes the table this one creates.

## Problem Statement

Consumers that react to chain events (notification services, reward systems, third-party integrations) need an ordered, resumable log feed they can follow without running their own chain infrastructure, and without the indexer-server knowing anything about them. Separately, when a processor's logic changes, its derived state must be rebuilt from scratch while the old state keeps being served, and re-fetching the entire history from the chain to do so is unacceptable.

Both needs are met by the same thing: the indexer-server keeping the log stream it already receives.

## Solution

The indexer-server stores the **emission stream** (append-only, retractions included, superseded rows flagged) and serves two views over it: the full `seq`-ordered stream for retraction-aware real-time consumers, and a canonical gated view (`alive`, bounded by a caller-supplied block gate, ordered by block and log index) for consumers that never want to handle a reorg.

Because the stream is stored locally and keyed independently of the processor version, a processor-logic upgrade can rebuild state by replaying that local stream rather than re-fetching the chain. **HOW that rebuild works is no longer this spec's, and stories 9-11 have moved.** This spec owns the STORAGE and the FEED: the emission table, the two views, cursor semantics, compaction, and the indexed topic columns.

## User Stories

1. As a consumer, I want to follow an ordered log feed from a cursor I control, so that I can resume after downtime without re-reading everything.
2. As a real-time consumer, I want the retraction-aware stream (including `removed` entries) with a monotonic `seq` cursor, so that I can act optimistically and cancel a pending action when a reorg retracts it.
3. As a simple consumer, I want a canonical view bounded by my own gate, with no retractions in it, so that my entire sync state is one advancing position and I never implement reorg handling.
4. As a consumer of the canonical view, I want my cursor validated against the block hash I last saw, so that a reorg tells me to rewind instead of silently skipping the events I never received.
5. As a consumer, I want cursor semantics that permit holes in `seq`, so that enabling stream compaction later cannot break me.
6. As an operator, I want the stream stored append-only with superseded rows flagged, so that no retraction information is ever destroyed and the canonical view stays a cheap derived read.
7. As an operator, I want optional pair-compaction (dropping a retracted entry together with its retraction, far below finality) as an off-by-default config, so that noise can be reclaimed deliberately and never by accident.
8. As an operator, I want the log table's `address` and `topic0..topic3` stored as indexed columns, so that a node-compatible `eth_getLogs` API is possible later without migrating the whole table.
> **Stories 9, 10 and 11 MOVED to `work/specs/proposed/the-server-and-cli-hold-generations-too.md`**, which supersedes them. They described ADR-0008's blue-green rebuild: replay into a new namespace keyed by the processor version hash, flip a pointer, DROP the old. That shape is now a special case of the GENERATION model (`a-reconfigure-is-not-an-outage`), and it is too narrow in two ways that matter here: keyed by the processor hash alone it cannot express a FILTER change, and dropping the old namespace at the flip is what makes a revert impossible. Building it and then replacing it would be paying twice, so the boundary moved rather than the work being duplicated. What this spec still OWES that one is the table underneath it, which is why it is `taskedAfter` this.

## Implementation Decisions

> **TASKED 2026-09-04. The detail that lived here now lives in the tasks**, which own what to build:
> the two discriminators and the digest that keys them, why nothing about the PROCESSOR enters this
> table, the name-keyed registry and the route segment, the opaque cursor and its three rules, the
> generation advertising, the topic columns and their one composite index, and the compaction depth.
> The durable WHY is already in `docs/adr/0006` (store emissions, derive the canonical view, cursor
> semantics, compaction off by default), `docs/adr/0019` (retention in block numbers, finality as the
> floor) and `docs/adr/0022` (pruning is a call the host schedules), which the tasks cite rather than
> restate.

> The tasks: `a-named-indexer-is-a-route-segment-and-a-registry-entry`,

> `a-consumer-follows-the-seq-ordered-stream-from-a-validated-opaque-cursor`,

## Out of Scope

- The state store, the ingestion wire and the host adapters, all covered by `historical-state-database`.
- **Rebuilding state on a processor or source change**, and everything the GENERATION model implies
  (holding several generations, the canonical pointer, moving it back, the caps). That is
  `work/specs/proposed/the-server-and-cli-hold-generations-too.md`, which absorbed stories 9-11 and
  is `taskedAfter` this spec. This spec owes it the table and the feed and nothing else.
- The `eth_getLogs` API itself (`work/specs/proposed/node-log-api.md`); this spec only owes it the schema it depends on.
- Trigger evaluation and delivery, which live entirely outside the indexer-server (`docs/adr/0005`).

## Further Notes

- The decisions are already made and recorded: `docs/adr/0006` (store emissions, derive the canonical view, cursor semantics, compaction). ADR-0008 (blue-green rebuild, chunked replay, why `getVersionHash` became load-bearing) is AMENDED and its rebuild half now belongs to `the-server-and-cli-hold-generations-too`; its chunked-replay and `getVersionHash` reasoning survives there unchanged.
- Story 4's rewind response has a proof worth keeping in mind while building: a reorg invalidates a contiguous suffix, so validating the single block at the cursor certifies the whole prefix behind it.
- The rebuild's trigger no longer lives here. `processor-version-hash-cannot-silently-lie` (now in `work/tasks/done/`, and ratified by ADR-0008's 2026-08-21 amendment) protects it, and the rebuild it protects is `the-server-and-cli-hold-generations-too`'s. Noted so the connection is not lost with the stories that moved.

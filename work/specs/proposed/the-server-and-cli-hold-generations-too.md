## Problem Statement

`a-reconfigure-is-not-an-outage` makes a reconfigure survivable by holding several GENERATIONS and
moving a canonical pointer. It is specified per NAMED INDEXER and per GENERATION rather than per runtime,
deliberately — but every landable that actually RUNS a generation is browser-side, and the two stream
keepers that exist are the filesystem and IndexedDB.

The server has the same problem and none of the machinery:

- `StreamBuilder` holds an `EventProcessor` and calls **`processor.clear()`** whenever the persisted
  cursor carries a different source, config or processor version — on `/ingest` and on
  `/ingest/expected-from-block`. That is the outage, with a concrete call site.
- Its stream is the ADR-0006 **emission-stream table** behind `RemoteSQL`, not ordinal segments in a
  key/value store, so `appending-to-the-stream-costs-the-batch`'s keeper does not serve it.
- ADR-0008 already decided a blue-green rebuild FOR THE SERVER, keyed by the processor version hash
  alone. Its 2026-08-31 amendment records that the key was too narrow (it cannot express a filter
  change) and points at the generation model — a pointer that currently leads to a spec with no
  server tier.

**And the CLI is the same runtime.** The goal is a CLI that runs what a server runs, so this is one
spec, not two. Older text describing the CLI as a one-shot `indexToTip` batch that never
reconfigures describes what it is today, not what it is becoming.

## Solution

The generation model, unchanged, over the server's storage. A generation is still a stream plus a
fold; one is canonical; the pointer moves when a successor is ready and moves back to revert.

Three things this runtime supplies that the browser one does not:

- **A stream keeper over the emission-stream table**, satisfying the same `ExistingStream` contract
  the two key/value keepers do.
- **A generation container above `StreamBuilder`**, so a changed context creates a successor instead
  of calling `processor.clear()`.
- **The canonical pointer as a table row**, which is what ADR-0008's `current_version` row becomes.

**This runtime is the SECOND cursor-record keeper, not the first.**
`appending-to-the-stream-costs-the-batch` fixes a CURSOR CONTRACT of three properties and leaves
PLACEMENT to each keeper, subject to the cursor living within its stream's subtree. A SQL keeper holds
its cursor in its own ROW and updates it in the SAME transaction as the segment insert, which
satisfies all three directly. The IndexedDB keeper already does exactly this with `setMany`, writing
one segment per batch and never rewriting anything, so there is prior art rather than novelty — which
is itself the argument for the shared conformance material, since a SECOND implementation is where it
earns its keep. Note there is no tail and no seal to port: those were a filesystem strategy and
filesystem storage is not supported.

## User Stories

1. As an operator, I want a feed whose context changed to be handled deliberately rather than by a
   silent `processor.clear()`.
2. As an operator, I want my server to keep answering queries from the canonical generation while a
   successor rebuilds, instead of serving progressively less.
3. As an operator, I want to move the pointer BACK to the previous generation when a new processor
   turns out worse, without re-ingesting.
4. As an operator, I want a rebuild in progress to be distinguishable from an empty result, which is
   the same absence-versus-contradiction distinction the reorg model and `SuspectedTruncationError`
   already make.
5. As an operator running MULTIPLE NAMED INDEXERS on one server or CLI, I want them fully isolated,
   so no query, prefix scan or cap in one can ever reach another's data.
6. As a developer, I want the CLI to run exactly what the server runs, so what I test locally is what
   deploys.
7. As an operator, I want a bound on how many generations a named indexer accumulates, and a loud
   refusal at the bound rather than a silent eviction.
8. As a maintainer, I want a processor-logic upgrade to rebuild state from the locally stored stream
   rather than from the chain, so an upgrade costs a local scan instead of a full re-index. (From
   `indexer-server-feed`, story 9.)
9. As a maintainer, I want the rebuild to run in BOUNDED CHUNKS against a durable checkpoint, so it
   completes on a serverless host that cannot hold a long-running loop. (From `indexer-server-feed`,
   story 10; ADR-0008's self-enqueueing queue reasoning survives unchanged, and the cron watchdog
   with it.)
10. As an operator, I want the canonical generation served throughout a rebuild and the pointer moved
    atomically at the end, so readers never observe partial state and a rollback before the move is
    free. (From `indexer-server-feed`, story 11 — now strictly stronger, because the retired
    generation is RETAINED under the caps rather than dropped, so the rollback stays free AFTER the
    move too.)

## Open questions

1. ~~What is the emission-stream table's schema, and does it exist yet?~~ **ANSWERED, and it is why
   this spec is `taskedAfter indexer-server-feed`.** `StreamBuilder`'s docstring (not ADR-0006's — an
   ADR has none) says it "does not store the emission stream: that arrives with ADR-0006, in the
   `indexer-server-feed` spec". That spec owns the table; this one consumes it.
2. ~~**How does a generation partition that table?**~~ **ANSWERED, and the premise was wrong: a
   generation does NOT partition that table.** `indexer-server-feed` partitions the LOG table on
   (INDEXER NAME, STREAM), as COLUMNS in its first migration, because ADR-0006 keys the STREAM on
   `{source, config}` and only the STATE on `{source, config, processor}`. Partitioning the log on
   anything carrying the processor would fork the stored stream on a processor-only change, which is
   the case this model promises is free and which story 8 rebuilds FROM. Generations partition the
   STATE. (Columns rather than a schema or a table per partition: neither SQLite nor D1 has schema
   namespaces, and a table per partition would push the log table into dynamic DDL that the server's
   fixed-schema file deliberately excludes.)

   **The KEY SHAPE is not open either, and it is now PINNED — this paragraph's premise has been
   ACTED ON and is kept only so the reasoning is not re-run.** `CONTEXT.md` decides that on this
   runtime the discriminator is STRUCTURAL, part of a composite key every read and write takes,
   never a field a query may omit and never defaulted. When this question was written,
   `indexer-server-feed` was ungated and created that table with no discriminator in it, so tasked
   first it would have shipped a primary key AND a public feed cursor and route with no tenant.
   **That is fixed**: that spec now carries BOTH discriminators (the indexer NAME and the STREAM) as
   columns from the first migration, and it is no longer ungated — it sits in `specs/proposed/` with
   a `taskedAfter` edge onto `a-reconfigure-is-not-an-outage`. So there is nothing left to do here;
   do not go and re-fix it. (The original note said this was "recorded as a finding against that
   spec". It was recorded IN that spec, which is what actually happened and the right home; `finding`
   is a pinned term for verified EXTERNAL ground truth in `work/notes/findings/` and no such file
   exists or should.)
3. **Does the CLI hold several generations, or one?** A long-running server clearly can. A one-shot
   batch arguably should not, and forcing it to would add a pointer read to a path that has no
   reconfigure. If they differ, the difference must be in the HOST rather than in the model.

   **The EVIDENCE below is written in the PRE-RENAME command vocabulary and the engine it names is
   being retired — re-check it before answering.** `CONTEXT.md` now pins a five-command set in which
   the one-shot is **`build`**, `index` is the RECEIVING half of a split, and `serve` is read-only;
   and `work/specs/ready/one-command-runs-the-whole-pipeline.md` moves all server-side folding onto
   `StreamBuilder`, so `indexToTip` and `EthereumIndexer` stop being the CLI's engine. The shape of
   the argument survives — different HOSTS over shared machinery is still where the difference would
   live — but the nouns do not.

   Evidence as checked at the time: `etherfold index` was a one-shot `indexToTip` that exits, and
   `etherfold serve` lazily imported `@etherfold/platform-nodejs` and ran the same server, so the two
   verbs were already different HOSTS over shared machinery.

   The evidence above is superseded by this answer and kept only so the reasoning is not re-run. Its
   nouns (`indexToTip`, `EthereumIndexer`) are retired; the shape of its argument -- different HOSTS
   over shared machinery -- is what survived, and is what the answer records.
4. ~~**Where does `project`'s VALUE come from on a server or CLI?**~~ **ANSWERED, and the concept was
   renamed with it.** There is no `project`: the unit is a NAMED INDEXER (`CONTEXT.md`), because once
   an indexer is one chain and one answer set, a separate tenancy axis above it was a synonym. The
   NAME arrives on **`upload`**, alongside the source info and the processor, modelled on the
   thegraph CLI minus its create step. It is supplied by the operator, never defaulted, and refused
   when absent.

   The value therefore comes from a DEPLOY-TIME manifest rather than a runtime code upload: the
   server never loads a processor module (`ServerOptions.getIngestion` is injected precisely so an
   HTTP app never has to), and the Worker host could not anyway, since `loadProcessorModule` is
   `import()` over a filesystem path. `upload` bundles and DEPLOYS; a host registers the N named
   indexers it was built with.
5. ~~**What replaces `processor.clear()` in `StreamBuilder`?**~~ **ANSWERED. The DELETION SWEEP is
   precise and was never the open part.** There is exactly ONE call site, in the private `currentLastSync()`, reached
   from BOTH public methods (`expectedFromBlock()` and `receive()`) and therefore from both ingest
   routes; its docstring already flags that reading can WRITE for this reason. In the generation
   model that branch stops discarding and instead resolves-or-creates the generation the incoming
   context names, leaving the canonical one answering.

   ~~What stays OPEN is whose cursor `expectedFromBlock()` answers with.~~ **ANSWERED by question 6
   below**: it answers PER WIRE CONTEXT, not per indexer, so the ambiguity dissolves. Two generations
   on the SAME stream (a processor-only change) share one stream and therefore one cursor and one
   answer; two generations on DIFFERENT streams have different contexts and get different answers.
   The number was only ambiguous while the endpoint was assumed to return exactly one.
6. ~~**How does a FILTER-change successor get its logs?**~~ **ANSWERED: a registry entry holds SEVERAL
   LIVE WIRE CONTEXTS, and `expected-from-block` answers with one entry per context.**

   The problem was real: `ServerOptions.getIngestion` yielded ONE `LogIngestion` with ONE readonly
   `WireContext`, and `assertContext` refuses a foreign `{source, config}` with a `400` that is
   deliberately NOT resumable — so a successor on a NEW stream could not receive logs at all while
   the old generation was still being fed. This is the server's version of the browser's "a successor
   follows the head itself", and it does not port, because in the browser the indexer owns its own
   fetching and here it does not.

   The resolution rides on what `indexer-server-feed` already builds. That spec introduces
   `/{indexer}/ingest` and a NAME-KEYED REGISTRY resolving one `LogIngestion` per named indexer, with
   ONE live context each. THIS spec widens a registry entry to hold several: the route selects the
   INDEXER, and the batch's own `{source, config}` then selects WHICH stream-builder within it
   receives the batch. A context in neither is still the existing `400`, so the refusal families are
   untouched.

   `POST /{indexer}/ingest/expected-from-block` correspondingly answers with one
   `{context, expectedFromBlock}` per LIVE context rather than a single pair. That is a WIDENING of
   what it does today — it already returns its `context` beside the block number, precisely so a
   sender knows which receiver it reached — and it is what lets one fetcher host run one fetch loop
   per context. Record it as a deliberate response-shape change with a changeset.

   The one thing to build carefully: a successor's context becomes live when the successor is created
   and stops being live when its generation is dropped or the successor becomes canonical and the old
   stream is reaped. That lifetime is this spec's, since it owns generation creation and the caps.

<!-- /open-questions -->

## Implementation Decisions

**None of the MODEL is re-decided here.** Generation identity (its STREAM plus the processor version
hash — the VERDICT decides whether anything is created at all, which is a different question and one
the model spec keeps deliberately separate), stream identity (the deduplicated `streamHash` digest plus the stream config hash),
the canonical pointer, the caps that refuse rather than evict, cap-and-drain pausing, and the
promotion policy defaulting to `on-catch-up` everywhere are all
`a-reconfigure-is-not-an-outage`'s and are consumed unchanged. Restating any of them here would
create a second source of truth that drifts.

**The INDEXER NAME is the discriminator**, structurally non-omittable, and it is the same composite
key `indexer-server-feed` pins on the emission table. That spec owns the table and now also owns the
physical mapping (COLUMNS, since neither SQLite nor D1 has schema namespaces); this spec consumes it.

**One name is one chain at a time**, and the consequence is worth stating because it removes a
feature rather than adding one: changing an indexer's chain moves `chainId`/`genesisHash` in the
block-0 skeleton entry, so it moves the source hash and therefore the STREAM — an ordinary
reconfigure that makes a new generation, with the old one retained and revertible. So this runtime
needs no chain axis in its tenancy key at all. Two chains live at once are two names.

**ADR-0008 is superseded in its KEY and its RETENTION, not in its mechanism.** Its rebuild-alongside
and flip-a-pointer shape is what this builds. Its namespace key (processor version hash alone) cannot
express a filter change and is replaced by the generation identity. Its drop-the-old-namespace rule is
replaced by the caps, which is what makes moving the pointer back possible. That amendment is already
recorded on the ADR; this spec is the thing it points at for the server.

## Testing Decisions

- **A context change creates a successor rather than calling `processor.clear()`**, asserted at that
  call site, which is the concrete outage this spec removes.
- **Queries keep being served from the canonical generation** across a full rebuild, and a rebuild in
  progress is distinguishable from an empty result.
- **The pointer moves back** and the previous generation answers exactly as before, with no
  re-ingestion.
- **The cursor contract is satisfied by the SQL keeper**, asserted against the same three properties
  as the IndexedDB keeper rather than against a layout — ideally through the shared conformance
  material `appending-to-the-stream-costs-the-batch` names, which is where a third implementation
  earns its keep.
- **Two NAMED INDEXERS with identical sources never touch each other's data**: same chain, same
  contracts, same processor; deleting everything in one leaves the other complete and readable. This
  is the multi-tenancy guard and it fails loudly under any missing discriminator.
- **The CLI and the server take the same path**, asserted by driving both through one fixture.

## Out of Scope

- **The generation model itself**, which is `a-reconfigure-is-not-an-outage`.
- **The client-side stream keepers**, which are `appending-to-the-stream-costs-the-batch`.
- **The GraphQL query frontend.** Decided elsewhere (Hono, Yoga, Pothos over entity declarations) and
  guaranteed a schema source by `one-processor-everywhere`. What this spec owes it is the
  once-per-read-unit-of-work generation resolution the sibling pins, so a query cannot straddle a
  promotion.
- **Seeding a generation from a published artifact**, which is
  `a-generation-can-be-seeded-from-a-published-artifact`.

## Further Notes

The dropped stub `work/specs/dropped/an-ingest-server-reconfigure-is-not-a-blackout.md` asked three
questions about this runtime and was dropped because the sibling spec answered them at the model
level. This spec is the part that stub could not have written: not whether the server holds
generations, but what it costs over `RemoteSQL` and the ADR-0006 table.

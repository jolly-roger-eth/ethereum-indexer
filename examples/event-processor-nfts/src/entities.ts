/**
 * The same question as `index.ts` -- who owns which token -- written against the
 * STORAGE SEAM instead of against a free-form object.
 *
 * This is the processor the browser demo in `browser/` runs, and it is the whole
 * point of the example: it names no backend. The deployment decides where the
 * state lives (versioned rows in IndexedDB in a tab, SQLite on a server, the
 * light patch store for a tab that only wants the tip), and nothing below
 * changes when it does.
 *
 * `index.ts` keeps the free-form `JSProcessor` version of the same logic. Two
 * processors in one example is deliberate and is the one place in this
 * repository where the SAME indexing question is written in both authoring
 * styles, so the cost of porting one to the other is readable in a diff. The
 * shapes are almost identical on purpose: `on<EventName>(state, event, config)`
 * either way, and only the WRITES differ -- `data.nfts.push(...)` against a draft
 * object here becomes `state.set(entity, id, values)` against a
 * `MutationContext`.

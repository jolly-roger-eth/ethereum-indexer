 * An application that indexes ONE ACCOUNT's NFTs in a browser tab, reading

 *
 * There is no server anywhere in this file. The tab talks to an Ethereum node --
 * by default the node behind the wallet the user picked -- decodes the logs,
 * runs `NFTProcessor` over them and keeps the resulting rows in IndexedDB. The
 * same processor object a server would run against SQLite.
 *
 * Read `start()` first: the connection, the store (ONE line, and the only place
 * a backend is named), the hook, and the two subscriptions that draw it.
 *
 * ## The two wallet target steps, and why this example needs both
 *
 * Whose NFTs are being indexed decides how much of the wallet is needed:
 *
 * - **`?account=` given** (someone else's, e.g. vitalik.eth): the address is
 *   already known, so nothing about the user's accounts is needed. The wallet is
 *   only a NODE. That is `targetStep: 'WalletChosen'` + `selectWallet()`, which
 *   picks a wallet via EIP-6963 and routes reads through it WITHOUT ever calling
 *   `eth_requestAccounts`. No permission popup to look at a public chain.
 * - **no `?account=`** ("my NFTs"): the address IS the user's, so the accounts
 *   have to be requested. That is `targetStep: 'WalletConnected'` + `connect()`.
 *
 * Asking for accounts in the first case would be permission theatre: reading
 * public logs needs no account, and a demo that pops a connect dialog to show
 * someone ELSE's tokens teaches the wrong reflex.

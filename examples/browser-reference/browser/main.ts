	 * entirely and keeps the OLD processor object running. Your edit does not take
	 * effect, and the only complaint is a `named-logs` warning most apps never
	 * route anywhere.
	 *
	 * Two ways to make an edit land, and they cost the same thing:
	 *   - bump `version` in the processor (the honest one -- see src/processor.ts)
	 *   - `updateProcessor(next, {force: true})` (when you cannot bump it)
	 *

	/**
	 * AXIS TWO: the contract was redeployed.
	 *
	 * On a local chain these apps deploy behind a PROXY, so a redeploy does NOT
	 * move the address. What moves is the implementation, and therefore the
	 * GENERATED ABI -- and the ABI is hashed into the indexing source, so handing
	 * the new source to `updateIndexer` is enough. It discards and re-indexes.
	 * `reset()` is NOT also needed; calling it would be a second full rebuild.
	 *
	 * If the ABI did NOT change, nothing is discarded, and that is correct rather
	 * than a gap: the same signatures over the same address still mean what the
	 * indexed rows say they mean.
	 *
	 * The case that looks like it needs a third branch -- an implementation that
	 * changed what its events MEAN while keeping their signatures -- does not,
	 * because it cannot happen without a PROCESSOR change. New meaning has to be
	 * implemented by new handler code, and writing that is the developer's job.
	 * So it travels AXIS ONE: bump `version`, and the swap discards and re-indexes.
	 * There is no `reset()` special case and nothing for this function to detect.
	 *
	 *   - ABI changed at the same address .......... updateIndexer({source})
	 *   - event MEANING changed ..................... edit the processor, bump `version`
	 *   - genesis hash changed (a different chain) . reload the page
	 *
	 * That last one is why a template's deployments store forces `location.reload()`
	 * only on a genesis change: a different chain invalidates the provider, the
	 * cursor and the store at once, and no in-place reconfigure covers that.
	 *
	 * THE ONE THING A REBUILD DOES NOT DO FOR YOU. A discard replays the WHOLE
	 * history, including blocks the previous implementation wrote. So a handler
	 * that merely implements the new meaning silently reinterprets pre-upgrade
	 * events under post-upgrade rules. The upgrade block is YOUR knowledge, and
	 * spending it is ordinary handler code -- `event.blockNumber` is on every
	 * event:
	 *
	 *     const weight = event.blockNumber >= UPGRADE_BLOCK ? next : previous;
	 *
	 * A local chain restarted with each deploy never meets this. A chain that keeps
	 * its history always does.

	 * This is not hypothetical and it is not only about the `unsubscribe` handle

	 * where `refreshPending` closed over a `const pending` declared in section 4,
	 * and the page died on load with `Cannot access 'pending' before
	 * initialization`. It typechecked perfectly. It was caught by
	 * `verify/reference.spec.ts` opening a real browser (ADR-0030).

	 * The rule that falls out: WIRE FIRST, SUBSCRIBE LAST.

 * HAZARD 1 -- THE SYNCHRONOUS SUBSCRIPTION.

 * `subscribe()` call, before that call has returned.
 *
 * Which means this, the obvious way to write it, is a bug:
 *
 *     const unsubscribe = connection.subscribe(($c) => {
 *         if (settled($c)) { unsubscribe(); resolve($c); }   // <-- throws
 *     });
 *
 * `unsubscribe` is a `const` in the temporal dead zone when the callback runs,
 * so every already-settled path throws `Cannot access 'unsubscribe' before
 * initialization`. The paths a human CLICKS through (a wallet picker, an
 * accounts prompt) resolve asynchronously and work fine, which is why this
 * survives casual manual testing and breaks for the returning user.
 *
 * The fix is the three lines below: declare with `let`, initialise to a no-op,
 * and defer the actual call so unsubscribing during the synchronous dispatch is
 * safe too.
